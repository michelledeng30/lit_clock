00:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,0:00,28.0, TIME 00:00:00 
00:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,0:00,45.0," Once the clock reached -00:00:15, the television networks got what they were waiting for. The Timer Controller began the verbal countdown. “15,” She said. “14... 13... 12... 11...” "
01:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,1:00,23.0,"” “Give me the Mountain Dew,” he said stoically. And then I heard footsteps outside. Footsteps. We’d waited till 1:00 to turn on the lights, figuring everyone would be long asleep—it was a school night after all—but footsteps, shit, and as the Colonel looked at me confused, I grabbed the Breathalyzer from him and stuffed it between the foam cushions of the couch and grabbed the Dixie cup and the Gatorade bottle of vodka and stashed them behind the COFFEE TABLE, and in one motion I grabbed a cigarette from a pack and lit it, hoping the smell of smoke would cover up the smell of booze. I puffed the cigarette without inhaling, trying to smoke up the room, and I was almost back to the couch when the three quick knocks came against the door and the Colonel looked at me, his eyes wide, his suddenly unpromising future flashing before his eyes, and I whispered, “Cry,” as the Eagle turned the knob. The Colonel hunched forward, his head between his knees and his shoulders shaking, and I put my arm around him as the Eagle came in. “I’m sorry,” I said before the Eagle could say anything."
01:40:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,1:40,41.0," By Monday, we’d mostly recovered. At least enough that we were both working at our own tables during the day (two thousand words hammered out on my end). Around 1:40, Gus held up the first note of the day: I TEXTED YOU."
01:40:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,1:40,41.0,"“Of course we should”. By Monday, we’d mostly recovered. At least enough that we were both working at our own tables during the day (two thousand words hammered out on my end). Around 1:40, Gus held up the first note of the day: I TEXTED YOU. I REMEMBER, I wrote back. A HISTORIC MOMENT IN OUR FRIENDSHIP. NO, he said."
03:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,3:00,27.0,"“There’s nothing more we can do”. “I want to drive through it,” he said. “Like she did”. We couldn’t risk leaving campus in the middle of the night like she had, so we left about twelve hours earlier, at 3:00 in the afternoon, with the Colonel behind the wheel of Takumi’s SUV. We asked Lara and Takumi to come along, but they were tired of chasing ghosts, and besides, finals were coming. It was a bright afternoon, and the sun bore down on the asphalt so that the ribbon of road before us quivered with heat. We drove a mile down Highway 119 and then merged onto I-65 northbound, heading toward the accident scene and Vine Station."
03:15:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,3:15,28.0,"And I had this secret. You’ve mostly figured this out, but the truth is that I saw her that night. I’d stayed up late with Lara and some people, and then I was falling asleep and I heard her crying outside my back window. It was like 3:15 that morning, maybe, and I walked out there and saw her walking through the soccer field. I tried to talk to her, but she was in a hurry. She told me that her mother was dead eight years that day, and that she always put flowers on her mother’s grave on the anniversary, but she forgot that year. She was out there looking for flowers, but it was too early—too wintry."
03:42:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,3:42am.,43.0," With a relieved sigh, he sank back in his chair. Checking the clock on his computer, he shook his head. 3:42am. "
04:20:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:20,5.0,"Through a buggy twilight, I walked to the pay phone, which was drilled into the wall between Rooms 44 and 45. On both sides of the phone, dozens of phone numbers and esoteric notes were written in pen and marker (205. 555. 1584; Tommy to airport 4:20; 773. 573. 6521; JG—Kuffs? )."
04:50:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:50,8.0,"“Not anymore,” Alaska said. “It’s fine. You’ll be fine”. I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle. At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner toward the classrooms."
04:56:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:56,8.0,"You’ll be fine”. I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle. At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner toward the classrooms. I never saw anything like it. Takumi wore a starched white shirt with a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie."
04:58:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:58,8.0,"I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle. At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner toward the classrooms. I never saw anything like it. Takumi wore a starched white shirt with a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie. They walked in step, heads up and shoulders back, like some kind of action-movie heroes."
05:20:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,5:20,30.0,  TIME TO ENGINE CUTOFF: 0005:20:39:06
06:13:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,6:13am,45.0," Bruce Ng sat in the JPL cafeteria along with hundreds of engineers who had given everything they had to Iris. They watched the large TV with rapt attention. It was 6:13am in Pasadena, yet every single employee was present. "
06:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,6:30,10.0,"Survival at Culver Creek meant loyalty, and she had ignored that. But then she’d shown me the way. She and the Colonel had taken the fall for me to show me how it was done, so I would know what to do when the time came. fifty-eight days before ABOUT A WEEK LATER I woke up at 6:30—6:30 on a Saturday! —to the sweet melody of Decapitation: automatic gunfire blasted out above the menacing, bass-heavy background music of the video game. I rolled over and saw Alaska pulling the controller up and to the right, as if that would help her escape certain death. I had the same bad habit."
06:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,6:30,13.0,"They still stored hay there, although I don’t know what for. It wasn’t like we had an equestrian program or anything. The Colonel, Takumi, and I got there first, setting up our sleeping bags on the softest bales of hay. It was 6:30. Alaska came shortly after, having told the Eagle she was spending the weekend with Jake. The Eagle didn’t check that story, because Alaska spent at least one weekend there every month, and he knew that her parents never cared. Lara showed up half an hour later."
07:30:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,7:30,31.0, It was 7:30 when Gus and I finally set out and 8:40 when we finally pulled in to Meg Ryan Night at Big Boy Bobby’s Drive-In. 
07:52:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,7:52,4.0,"I went to bed wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and socks. No matter how miserably hot it got, I resolved, I would sleep in my clothes every night at the Creek, feeling—probably for the first time in my life—the fear and excitement of living in a place where you never know what’s going to happen or when. one hundred twenty-six days before “WELL, NOW IT’S WAR,” the Colonel shouted the next morning. I rolled over and looked at the clock: 7:52. My first Culver Creek class, French, started in eighteen minutes. I blinked a couple times and looked up at the Colonel, who was standing between the couch and the COFFEE TABLE, holding his well-worn, once-white tennis shoes by the laces. For a long time, he stared at me, and I stared at him."
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,31.0," Today I got up hours earlier than I needed to. It was like Christmas morning! I could hardly wait for 08:00 to roll around. I had breakfast, did some unnecessary checks on Hab equipment, and read some Poirot. Finally the time came! "
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,30.0, Earth is about to set. Resume 08:00 my time tomorrow morning. Tell family I’m fine. Give crew my best. Tell Commander Lewis disco sucks. 
08:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:00,17.0,"But it worked well enough. The Eagle tore out of his house as soon as the first string of firecrackers started popping—he was waiting for us, I suppose—and we headed for the woods and got him in deeply enough that he never heard her drive away. The Colonel and I doubled back, wading through the creek to save time, slipped in through the back window of Room 43, and slept like babies. after the day after THE COLONEL SLEPT the not-restful sleep of the drunk, and I lay on my back on the bottom bunk, my mouth tingling and alive as if still kissing, and we would have likely slept through our morning classes had the Eagle not awoken us at 8:00 with three quick knocks. I rolled over as he opened the door, and the morning light rushed into the room. “I need y’all to go to the gym,” he said. I squinted toward him, the Eagle himself backlit into invisibility by the too bright sun."
08:01:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:01,44.0, [08:01]WATNEY: How's my care package coming along? 
08:02:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:02,3.0,"It reminded me of nights in Florida—except with better food and no air-conditioning. Lying in bed and reading felt pleasantly familiar. I decided to heed what I’m sure would have been my mother’s advice and get a good night’s sleep before my first day of classes. French II started at 8:10, and figuring it couldn’t take more than eight minutes to put on some clothes and walk to the classrooms, I set my alarm for 8:02. I took a shower, and then lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me from the heat. Around 11:00, I realized that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might make more of a difference if I took off my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top of the sheets wearing just boxers. A decision I found myself regretting some hours later when I awoke to two sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy hell out of me."
08:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:02,43.0," [08:02]JPL: We've spun up a project to get you food. It's been in progress for a week or so. We can get it to you before you starve, but it'll be tight. It'll just be food and a radio. We can't send an Oxygenator, Water Reclaimer, or any of that other stuff without powered descent. "
08:10:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:10,4.0,"And then we need to go ahead and start thinking about how we’re going to ruin their miserable little lives”. When I received the Culver Creek Handbook over the summer and noticed happily that the “Dress Code” section contained only two words, casual modesty, it never occurred to me that girls would show up for class half asleep in cotton pajama shorts, T-shirts, and flip-flops. Modest, I guess, and casual. And there was something about girls wearing pajamas (even if modest), which might have made French at 8:10 in the morning bearable, if I’d had any idea what Madame O’Malley was talking about. Comment dis-tu “Oh my God, I don’t know nearly enough French to pass French II” en franCais? My French I class back in Florida did not prepare me for Madame O’Malley, who skipped the “how was your summer” pleasantries and dove directly into something called the passé composé, which is apparently a verb tense. Alaska sat directly across from me in the circle of desks, but she didn’t look at me once the entire class, even though I could notice little but her."
08:12:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:12,42.0, [08:12]WATNEY: Test. 
08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,44.0," [08:16]JPL: A little behind schedule, but we'll get it done. In the mean time, we want you to get back to work. We're satisfied the Hab's is in good condition. Maintenance only takes you 12 hours per week. We're going to pack the rest of your time with research and experiments. "
08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,43.0," [08:16]WATNEY: No complaints here! You get me the food, I'll be a happy camper. I've got all Hab systems up and running again. The Water Reclaimer is working fine now that I replaced the burst hoses. As for water supply, I have 620L remaining. I started with 900L (300 to start with, 600 more from reducing hydrazine). So I lost almost 300L to sublimation. Still, with the Water Reclaimer operational again, it's plenty. "
08:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:25,42.0, [08:25]JPL: Received! You gave us quite a scare there. Thanks for the “A-OK” message. Our analysis of satellite imagery shows a complete detachment of Airlock 1. Is that correct? What’s your status? Include your personal health and Hab equipment. 
08:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:30,10.0,"There are times when it is appropriate, even preferable, to get an erection when someone’s face is in close proximity to your penis. This was not one of those times. So I stopped thinking about the layers and the warmth, muted the TV, and focused on Decapitation. At 8:30, I turned off the game and scooted out from underneath Alaska. She turned onto her back, still asleep, the lines of my corduroy pants imprinted on her cheek. I usually only called my parents on Sunday afternoons, so when my mom heard my voice, she instantly overreacted. “What’s wrong, Miles?"
08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,44.0, [08:31]WATNEY: Great! I'm sick of sitting on my ass. I'm going to be here for years. You may as well make use of me. 
08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,43.0," [08:31]JPL: Good, keep us posted on any mechanical or electronic problems. By the way, the name of the probe we're sending is “Iris”. Named after the Greek goddess who traveled the heavens with the speed of wind. She's also the goddess of rainbows. "
08:39:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:39,42.0," [08:39]WATNEY: If by “detachment” you mean “shot me out like a cannon” then yeah. Minor cut on my forehead. Had some issues with my EVA suit (I’ll explain later). I patched up the Hab and repressurized it (main air tanks were intact). I just got power back online. Primary air and water tanks were unharmed. The rover, solar array, and Pathfinder were out of blast range. I’ll run diagnostics on the Hab’s systems while I wait for your next reply. By the way, who am I talking to? "
08:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:41,79.0, [08:41]MAV: You fucking kidding me? 
08:45:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:45,54.0," I started my EVA around 08:45, same as always. I got my hammer and screwdriver and started chipping the trailer's hull. It's a pain in the ass to make a chip before each drilling, so I make all the day's chips in a single go. "
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,43.0, [08:47]WATNEY: Gay probe coming to save me. Got it. 
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,44.0," [08:47]JPL: That's what we're thinking. We'll get you a schedule as soon as the science team puts it together. It'll be mostly of EVAs, geological samples, soil tests, and weekly self-administered medical tests. Honestly, this is the best “bonus Mars time” we've had since the Opportunity lander. "
08:52:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:52,42.0," [08:52]JPL: Venkat Kapoor, in Houston. Pasadena relays my messages. I'm going to handle all direct communication with you from now on. Check the Oxygenator and Water Reclaimer first. They’re the most important. "
09:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:00,65.0," “Uh, yeah,” Mindy said, typing on her keyboard. “I noticed things would always change around 9am local time. People usually keep the same patterns so I figured he likes to start work around then. I did some minor realignment to get seventeen pics between 9:00 and 9:10. He showed up in one of them.” "
09:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,9:00 A.M.,16.0,"“You’ll be fine”. He finished, stood up, and said, “I finally found something that can stop the fox. The fox cannot summit Strawberry Hill”. Alaska and Lara walked to their rooms, planning to check in with the Eagle later in the day, while Takumi and I stood behind the Colonel as he knocked on the Eagle’s door at 9:00 A.M. “Y’all are home early. Have fun? ” “Yes sir,” the Colonel said. “How’s your mom, Chip?"
09:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:02,44.0, [09:02]WATNEY: Opportunity never went back to Earth. 
09:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:05,42.0, [09:05]WATNEY: Duh. Oxygenator functioning perfectly. Water Reclaimer is completely offline. Best guess is water froze up inside and burst some tubing. I’m sure I can fix it. Hab’s main computer also functioning without any problems. Any idea what caused the Hab to blow up? 
09:09:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:09,79.0, [09:09]MAV: You're sending me into space in a convertible. 
09:14:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:14am.,44.0," “The launch preparations are complete,” Annie Montrose said to the press room. “Iris is ready to go. The scheduled launch is 9:14am. "
09:17:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:17,44.0, [09:17]JPL: Sorry. Bad analogy. 
09:18:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:18,42.0," [09:18]JPL: Best guess is fatigue on the canvas near Airlock 1. The pressurization cycle stressed it until it failed. From now on, alternate Airlock 2 and 3 for all EVAs. Also, we’ll be getting you a checklist and procedures for a full canvas exam. "
09:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:24,79.0, [09:24]HOUSTON: There will be Hab canvas covering the holes. It will provide enough aerodynamics in Mars's atmosphere. 
09:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:31,42.0," [09:31]WATNEY: Yay, I get to stare at a wall for several hours! By the way, the farm is dead. I’ve recovered as many potatoes as I could and stored them outside. I count 1841. That will last me 184 days. Including the remaining mission rations, I’ll start starving on Sol 584. "
09:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:38,79.0, [09:38]MAV: So it's a ragtop. Much better. 
09:44:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:44,42.0," [09:44]JPL: Yeah, we figured. Working on it. "
09:55:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:55,79.0," [09:55]HOUSTON: Admittedly, they are very invasive modifications, but they have to be done. The procedure doc we sent has instructions for each of these steps with tools you have on hand. Also, you'll need to start electrolyzing water to get the hydrogen for the fuel plant. We'll send you procedures for that shortly. "
10:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:07,53.0," [10:07] Watney: Power line modifications complete. Hooked it up to a drill, and it works great. Plenty of daylight left. Send me a description of that hole you want me to cut. "
10:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:25,53.0," [10:25] JPL: Glad to hear it. Starting on the cut sounds great. Just to be clear, these are modifications to Rover 1, which we've been calling “the trailer.” Rover 2 (the one with your modifications for the trip to Pathfinder) should remain as-is for now. "
10:43:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:43,53.0, [10:43] Watney: Roger. Take a pic at 11:30 if you haven't heard from me by then. 
11:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:00,17.0,"“We classin’ it up! ” “It’s an old-time Southern drinking contest,” Alaska responded. “We’s a-gonna treat Pudge to an evening of real Southern livin’: We go’n match each other Dixie cup for Dixie cup till the lesser drinker falls”. And that is pretty much what they did, pausing only to turn out the lights at 11:00 so the Eagle wouldn’t drop by. They chatted some, but mostly they drank, and I drifted out of the conversation and ended up squinting through the dark, looking at the book spines in Alaska’s Life Library. Even minus the books she’d lost in the mini-flood, I could have stayed up until morning reading through the haphazard stacks of titles. A dozen white tulips in a plastic vase were precariously perched atop one of the book stacks, and when I asked her about them, she just said, “Jake and my’s anniversary,” and I didn’t care to continue that line of dialogue, so I went back to scanning titles, and I was just wondering how I could go about learning Edgar Allan Poe’s last words (for the record: “Lord help my poor soul”) when I heard Alaska say, “Pudge isn’t even listening to us”."
11:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:00,3.0,"I decided to heed what I’m sure would have been my mother’s advice and get a good night’s sleep before my first day of classes. French II started at 8:10, and figuring it couldn’t take more than eight minutes to put on some clothes and walk to the classrooms, I set my alarm for 8:02. I took a shower, and then lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me from the heat. Around 11:00, I realized that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might make more of a difference if I took off my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top of the sheets wearing just boxers. A decision I found myself regretting some hours later when I awoke to two sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy hell out of me. I woke up completely and instantly, sitting up straight in bed, terrified, and I couldn’t understand the voices for some reason, couldn’t understand why there were any voices at all, and what the hell time was it anyway? And finally my head cleared enough to hear, “C’mon, kid."
11:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:00,29.0," Spell with ASCII. Numbers 0-F at 21 degree increments. Will watch camera starting 11:00 my time. When message done, return to this position. Wait 20 minutes after completion to take picture (So I can write and post reply). Repeat process at top of every hour. "
11:03:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:03,4.0,"I didn’t know anyone and couldn’t even figure out whom I should be trying to know, and the classes were hard, even on the first day. My dad had told me I’d have to study, and now I believed him. The teachers were serious and smart and a lot of them went by “Dr.,” and so when the time came for my last class before lunch, World Religions, I felt tremendous relief. A vestige from when Culver Creek was a Christian boys’ school, I figured the World Religions class, required of every junior and senior, might be an easy A. It was my only class all day where the desks weren’t arranged either in a square or a circle, so, not wanting to seem eager, I sat down in the third row at 11:03. I was seven minutes early, partly because I liked to be punctual, and partly because I didn’t have anyone to chat with out in the halls. Shortly thereafter, the Colonel came in with Takumi, and they sat down on opposite sides of me. “I heard about last night,” Takumi said."
11:18:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:18,32.0," [11:18]JPL: Mark, this is Venkat Kapoor. We’ve been watching you since Sol 49. The whole world’s been rooting for you. Amazing job, getting Pathfinder. We’re working on rescue plans. JPL is adjusting Ares 4’s MDV to do a short overland flight. They’ll pick you up, then take you with them to Schiaparelli. We’re putting together a supply mission to keep you fed till Ares 4 arrives. "
11:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:29,32.0," [11:29]WATNEY: Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying. I want to make it clear it wasn’t the crew’s fault. Side question: What did they say when they found out I was alive? Also, “Hi, mom!” "
11:40:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:40,26.0,"But the Creek was rife with gossips—particularly the Weekday Warriors, and if just one person told one friend who told one friend who told one friend who told the Eagle, everything would fall apart. The Creek’s don’t-rat ethos withstood the test nicely, but when Maxx/Stan/Dr. Morse didn’t shown up by 11:50 that morning, I thought the Colonel would lose his shit. He sat on the bumper of a car in the student parking lot, his head bowed, his hands running through his thick mop of dark hair over and over again, as if he were trying to find something in there. Maxx had promised to arrive by 11:40, twenty minutes before the official start of Speaker Day, giving him time to learn the speech and everything. I stood next to the Colonel, worried but quiet, waiting. We’d sent Takumi to call “the agency” and learn the whereabouts of “the performer”. “Of all the things I thought could go wrong, this was not one of them."
11:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:41,32.0, [11:41]JPL: Tell us about your “crops”. We estimated your food packs would last until Sol 400 at 3/4 ration per meal. Will your crops affect that number? As to your question: We haven’t told the crew you’re alive yet. We wanted them to concentrate on their own mission. 
11:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:41am,77.0," “At his usual rate of 90km per sol,” Mindy said, “he should get there on Sol 504. Sol 505 if he takes his time. He always drives in the early morning, finishing around noon.” She checked an application on her laptop. “Noon on Sol 504 will be 11:41am this Wednesday here in Houston. Noon on Sol 505 will be 12:21pm on Thursday.” "
11:45:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,11:45,52.0," I didn’t hear from Gus again until 11:45, when he texted me, Ready in 5?"
11:49:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:49,54.0, [11:49] JPL: What we can see of your planned cut looks good. We're assuming the other side is identical. You're cleared to start drilling. 
11:50:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:50,26.0,"As I sat through my classes that morning, I could think of nothing else. Every junior in the school had known for two weeks, and so far not even the faintest rumor had leaked out. But the Creek was rife with gossips—particularly the Weekday Warriors, and if just one person told one friend who told one friend who told one friend who told the Eagle, everything would fall apart. The Creek’s don’t-rat ethos withstood the test nicely, but when Maxx/Stan/Dr. Morse didn’t shown up by 11:50 that morning, I thought the Colonel would lose his shit.

11:52:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:52,32.0," [11:52]WATNEY: The crops are potatoes, grown from the ones we were supposed to prepare on Thanksgiving. They’re doing great, but the available farmland isn’t enough for sustainability. I’ll run out food around Sol 900. Also: Tell the crew I’m alive! What the fuck is wrong with you? "
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:00,54.0," At 12:00, I took a break. Back in the Hab, I enjoyed a nice lunch and played some chess against the computer (it kicked my ass). Then back out for the day's second EVA. "
12:00:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:00,50.0," I set the clock to 12:00. Then I use the dry-erase marker to draw a long line from the center toward the twelve and a short line from the center to the two. I’d rather sleep a solid eight hours, but I don’t want to keep Rocky waiting too long. I’ll settle for a two-hour nap. “I’ll come back when the clock matches this,” I say. As if that would help him understand."
12:04:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:04,32.0," [12:04]JPL: We’ll get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double-check your work. Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure. Sol 900 is great news. It’ll give us a lot more time to get the supply mission together. Also, please watch your language. Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world. "
12:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:07,54.0, [12:07] Watney: That's what she said. 
12:15:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:15,32.0, [12:15]WATNEY: Look! A pair of boobs! -> (.Y.) 
12:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:25,54.0," [12:25] JPL: Seriously, Mark? Seriously? "
12:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,12:30,12.0,"She looked at it for a moment, then handed me a white one and a lighter. We spent all morning burning candles—well, and occasionally lighting cigarettes off the burning candles after we stuffed a towel into the crack at the bottom of her door. Over the course of two hours, we added a full foot to the summit of her polychrome candle volcano. “Mount St. Helens on acid,” she said At 12:30, after two hours of me begging for a ride to McDonald’s, Alaska decided it was time for lunch. As we began to walk to the student parking lot, I saw a strange car. A small green car. A hatchback."
12:30:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:30,107.0," I came to the meeting on time. At least, I thought I did. The email said 12:30. But when I got there, everyone was already seated. And silent. And they were all staring at me."
12:38:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:38 p.m.,109.0, I checked my watch—12:38 p.m. I had four and a half hours to decide.
13:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:07,78.0, [13:07]HOUSTON: Congratulations from all of us here at Mission Control! Well done! What's your status? 
13:21:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:21,78.0," [13:21]MAV: Thanks! No health or physical problems. The rover and trailer are getting pretty worn out, but still functional. Oxygenator and Regulator both working fine. I didn't bring the Water Reclaimer. Just brought the water. Plenty of potatoes left. I'm good to last till 549. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55.0, Pathfinder was no longer talking to the rover. It had stopped answering pings 4 hours and 24 minutes ago. Some quick math told me that was around 13:30 today. 
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,54.0," At 13:30 my ruination occurred, though I didn't realize it at the time. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55.0," At 13:30, I leaned the drill against the workbench. The drill's cowling was off to make room for the power line. The workbench is metal. If the drill leaned against the workbench just right, it could make a metal-to-metal connection. "
13:36:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:36,78.0," [13:36]HOUSTON: Glad to hear it. Hermes is still on track for a Sol 549 flyby. As you know, the MAV will need to lose some weight to make the intercept. We're going to get you those procedures within the day. How much water do you have? What did you do with urine? "
13:50:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:50,78.0, [13:50]MAV: I have 550L of remaining water. I've been dumping urine outside along the way. 
14:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:05,78.0, [14:05]HOUSTON: Preserve all water. Don't do any more urine dumps. Store it somewhere. Turn the rover's radio on and leave it on. We can contact it through MAV. 
14:10:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,2:10pm.,72.0," Mindy trudged to her computer. Today's shift began at 2:10pm. Her schedule matched Watney's every day. She slept when he slept. Watney simply slept at night on Mars, while Mindy had to drift 40 minutes forward every day, taping aluminum foil to her windows to get any sleep at all. "
14:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:38,53.0, [14:38]JPL: I'm sure you're wondering how to cut a hole in the rover. 
16:03:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,16:03,46.0, [16:03]WATNEY: How'd the launch go? 
16:56:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:56 P.M.,1.0,"She cooked a small mountain of artichoke dip. She festooned our living room in green and yellow streamers, the colors of my new school. She bought two dozen champagne poppers and placed them around the edge of our coffee table. And when that final Friday came, when my packing was mostly done, she sat with my dad and me on the living-room couch at 4:56 P.M. and patiently awaited the arrival of the Good-bye to Miles Cavalry. Said cavalry consisted of exactly two people: Marie Law-son, a tiny blonde with rectangular glasses, and her chunky (to put it charitably) boyfriend, Will. “Hey, Miles,” Marie said as she sat down. “Hey,” I said."
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,55.0," I finished my day at 17:00 after drilling 131 holes. Not as good as yesterday, but I lost some time to the drill malfunction. "
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,54.0," By 17:00, when the sun began to set, I had drilled 75 holes. A good start, but there's still tons to do. Eventually (probably tomorrow) I'll have to start drilling holes that I can't reach from the ground. For that I'll need something to stand on. "
17:08:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:08,55.0," [17:08] Watney: 131 holes today. 488 total. Minor drill issue; it tripped the breakers. There may be an intermittent short in the drill, probably in the attachment point of the power line. Might need to redo it. "
17:12:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:12,54.0, [17:12] Watney: 145 holes today. 357 total. 
17:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:31,54.0, [17:31] JPL: We thought you'd have more done by now.

19:22:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:22,81.0," [19:22]JOHANSSEN: Hello, Mark. "
19:23:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:23,81.0, [19:23]MAV: Johanssen!? Holy crap! They finally letting you talk to me directly? 
19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81.0, [19:24]MAV: What took them so long to let us talk? 
19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81.0," [19:24]JOHANSSEN: Yes, NASA gave the OK for direct communication an hour ago. We're only 35 light-seconds apart, so we can talk in near-realtime. I just set up the system and I'm testing it out. "
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81.0, [19:25]MAV: What? Just cause you guys abandoned me on a godforsaken planet with no chance of survival? 
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81.0, [19:25]JOHANSSEN: The psych team was worried about personality conflicts. 
19:26:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:26,81.0, [19:26]JOHANSSEN: Funny. Don't make that kind of joke with Lewis. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81.0, [19:27]MAV: Roger. So uh... thanks for coming back to get me. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81.0, [19:27]JOHANSSEN: It's the least we could do. How is the MAV retrofit going? 
19:28:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:28,81.0," [19:28]MAV: So far, so good. NASA put a lot of thought into the procedures. They work. That's not to say they're easy. I spent the last 3 days removing Hull Panel 19 and the front window. Even in Mars-G they're heavy motherfuckers. "
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81.0, [19:29]JOHANSSEN: I didn't type that! That was Martinez! I stepped away from the console for like 10 seconds! 
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81.0, [19:29]MAV: I've really missed you guys. 
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81.0," [19:29]JOHANSSEN: When we pick you up, I will make wild, passionate love to you. Prepare your body. "
