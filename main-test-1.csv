00:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,0:00,28, TIME 00:00:00 
00:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,0:00,45," Once the clock reached -00:00:15, the television networks got what they were waiting for. The Timer Controller began the verbal countdown. “15,” She said. “14... 13... 12... 11...” "
03:42:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,3:42am.,43," With a relieved sigh, he sank back in his chair. Checking the clock on his computer, he shook his head. 3:42am. "
05:20:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,5:20,30,  TIME TO ENGINE CUTOFF: 0005:20:39:06
06:13:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,6:13am,45," Bruce Ng sat in the JPL cafeteria along with hundreds of engineers who had given everything they had to Iris. They watched the large TV with rapt attention. It was 6:13am in Pasadena, yet every single employee was present. "
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,30, Earth is about to set. Resume 08:00 my time tomorrow morning. Tell family I’m fine. Give crew my best. Tell Commander Lewis disco sucks. 
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,31," Today I got up hours earlier than I needed to. It was like Christmas morning! I could hardly wait for 08:00 to roll around. I had breakfast, did some unnecessary checks on Hab equipment, and read some Poirot. Finally the time came! "
08:01:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:01,44, [08:01]WATNEY: How's my care package coming along? 
08:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:02,43," [08:02]JPL: We've spun up a project to get you food. It's been in progress for a week or so. We can get it to you before you starve, but it'll be tight. It'll just be food and a radio. We can't send an Oxygenator, Water Reclaimer, or any of that other stuff without powered descent. "
08:12:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:12,42, [08:12]WATNEY: Test. 
08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,43," [08:16]WATNEY: No complaints here! You get me the food, I'll be a happy camper. I've got all Hab systems up and running again. The Water Reclaimer is working fine now that I replaced the burst hoses. As for water supply, I have 620L remaining. I started with 900L (300 to start with, 600 more from reducing hydrazine). So I lost almost 300L to sublimation. Still, with the Water Reclaimer operational again, it's plenty. "
08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,44," [08:16]JPL: A little behind schedule, but we'll get it done. In the mean time, we want you to get back to work. We're satisfied the Hab's is in good condition. Maintenance only takes you 12 hours per week. We're going to pack the rest of your time with research and experiments. "
08:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:25,42, [08:25]JPL: Received! You gave us quite a scare there. Thanks for the “A-OK” message. Our analysis of satellite imagery shows a complete detachment of Airlock 1. Is that correct? What’s your status? Include your personal health and Hab equipment. 
08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,43," [08:31]JPL: Good, keep us posted on any mechanical or electronic problems. By the way, the name of the probe we're sending is “Iris”. Named after the Greek goddess who traveled the heavens with the speed of wind. She's also the goddess of rainbows. "
08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,44, [08:31]WATNEY: Great! I'm sick of sitting on my ass. I'm going to be here for years. You may as well make use of me. 
08:39:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:39,42," [08:39]WATNEY: If by “detachment” you mean “shot me out like a cannon” then yeah. Minor cut on my forehead. Had some issues with my EVA suit (I’ll explain later). I patched up the Hab and repressurized it (main air tanks were intact). I just got power back online. Primary air and water tanks were unharmed. The rover, solar array, and Pathfinder were out of blast range. I’ll run diagnostics on the Hab’s systems while I wait for your next reply. By the way, who am I talking to? "
08:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:41,79, [08:41]MAV: You fucking kidding me? 
08:45:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:45,54," I started my EVA around 08:45, same as always. I got my hammer and screwdriver and started chipping the trailer's hull. It's a pain in the ass to make a chip before each drilling, so I make all the day's chips in a single go. "
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,43, [08:47]WATNEY: Gay probe coming to save me. Got it. 
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,44," [08:47]JPL: That's what we're thinking. We'll get you a schedule as soon as the science team puts it together. It'll be mostly of EVAs, geological samples, soil tests, and weekly self-administered medical tests. Honestly, this is the best “bonus Mars time” we've had since the Opportunity lander. "
08:52:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:52,42," [08:52]JPL: Venkat Kapoor, in Houston. Pasadena relays my messages. I'm going to handle all direct communication with you from now on. Check the Oxygenator and Water Reclaimer first. They’re the most important. "
09:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:00,65," “Uh, yeah,” Mindy said, typing on her keyboard. “I noticed things would always change around 9am local time. People usually keep the same patterns so I figured he likes to start work around then. I did some minor realignment to get seventeen pics between 9:00 and 9:10. He showed up in one of them.” "
09:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:02,44, [09:02]WATNEY: Opportunity never went back to Earth. 
09:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:05,42, [09:05]WATNEY: Duh. Oxygenator functioning perfectly. Water Reclaimer is completely offline. Best guess is water froze up inside and burst some tubing. I’m sure I can fix it. Hab’s main computer also functioning without any problems. Any idea what caused the Hab to blow up? 
09:09:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:09,79, [09:09]MAV: You're sending me into space in a convertible. 
09:14:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:14am.,44," “The launch preparations are complete,” Annie Montrose said to the press room. “Iris is ready to go. The scheduled launch is 9:14am. "
09:17:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:17,44, [09:17]JPL: Sorry. Bad analogy. 
09:18:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:18,42," [09:18]JPL: Best guess is fatigue on the canvas near Airlock 1. The pressurization cycle stressed it until it failed. From now on, alternate Airlock 2 and 3 for all EVAs. Also, we’ll be getting you a checklist and procedures for a full canvas exam. "
09:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:24,79, [09:24]HOUSTON: There will be Hab canvas covering the holes. It will provide enough aerodynamics in Mars's atmosphere. 
09:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:31,42," [09:31]WATNEY: Yay, I get to stare at a wall for several hours! By the way, the farm is dead. I’ve recovered as many potatoes as I could and stored them outside. I count 1841. That will last me 184 days. Including the remaining mission rations, I’ll start starving on Sol 584. "
09:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:38,79, [09:38]MAV: So it's a ragtop. Much better. 
09:44:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:44,42," [09:44]JPL: Yeah, we figured. Working on it. "
09:55:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:55,79," [09:55]HOUSTON: Admittedly, they are very invasive modifications, but they have to be done. The procedure doc we sent has instructions for each of these steps with tools you have on hand. Also, you'll need to start electrolyzing water to get the hydrogen for the fuel plant. We'll send you procedures for that shortly. "
10:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:07,53," [10:07] Watney: Power line modifications complete. Hooked it up to a drill, and it works great. Plenty of daylight left. Send me a description of that hole you want me to cut. "
10:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:25,53," [10:25] JPL: Glad to hear it. Starting on the cut sounds great. Just to be clear, these are modifications to Rover 1, which we've been calling “the trailer.” Rover 2 (the one with your modifications for the trip to Pathfinder) should remain as-is for now. "
10:43:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:43,53, [10:43] Watney: Roger. Take a pic at 11:30 if you haven't heard from me by then. 
11:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:00,29," Spell with ASCII. Numbers 0-F at 21 degree increments. Will watch camera starting 11:00 my time. When message done, return to this position. Wait 20 minutes after completion to take picture (So I can write and post reply). Repeat process at top of every hour. "
11:18:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:18,32," [11:18]JPL: Mark, this is Venkat Kapoor. We’ve been watching you since Sol 49. The whole world’s been rooting for you. Amazing job, getting Pathfinder. We’re working on rescue plans. JPL is adjusting Ares 4’s MDV to do a short overland flight. They’ll pick you up, then take you with them to Schiaparelli. We’re putting together a supply mission to keep you fed till Ares 4 arrives. "
11:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:29,32," [11:29]WATNEY: Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying. I want to make it clear it wasn’t the crew’s fault. Side question: What did they say when they found out I was alive? Also, “Hi, mom!” "
11:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:41,32, [11:41]JPL: Tell us about your “crops”. We estimated your food packs would last until Sol 400 at 3/4 ration per meal. Will your crops affect that number? As to your question: We haven’t told the crew you’re alive yet. We wanted them to concentrate on their own mission. 
11:41:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:41am,77," “At his usual rate of 90km per sol,” Mindy said, “he should get there on Sol 504. Sol 505 if he takes his time. He always drives in the early morning, finishing around noon.” She checked an application on her laptop. “Noon on Sol 504 will be 11:41am this Wednesday here in Houston. Noon on Sol 505 will be 12:21pm on Thursday.” "
11:49:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:49,54, [11:49] JPL: What we can see of your planned cut looks good. We're assuming the other side is identical. You're cleared to start drilling. 
11:52:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,11:52,32," [11:52]WATNEY: The crops are potatoes, grown from the ones we were supposed to prepare on Thanksgiving. They’re doing great, but the available farmland isn’t enough for sustainability. I’ll run out food around Sol 900. Also: Tell the crew I’m alive! What the fuck is wrong with you? "
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:00,54," At 12:00, I took a break. Back in the Hab, I enjoyed a nice lunch and played some chess against the computer (it kicked my ass). Then back out for the day's second EVA. "
12:00:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:00,50," I set the clock to 12:00. Then I use the dry-erase marker to draw a long line from the center toward the twelve and a short line from the center to the two. I’d rather sleep a solid eight hours, but I don’t want to keep Rocky waiting too long. I’ll settle for a two-hour nap. “I’ll come back when the clock matches this,” I say. As if that would help him understand."
12:04:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:04,32," [12:04]JPL: We’ll get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double-check your work. Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure. Sol 900 is great news. It’ll give us a lot more time to get the supply mission together. Also, please watch your language. Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world. "
12:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:07,54, [12:07] Watney: That's what she said. 
12:15:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:15,32, [12:15]WATNEY: Look! A pair of boobs! -> (.Y.) 
12:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:25,54," [12:25] JPL: Seriously, Mark? Seriously? "
12:30:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:30,107," I came to the meeting on time. At least, I thought I did. The email said 12:30. But when I got there, everyone was already seated. And silent. And they were all staring at me."
12:38:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:38 p.m.,109, I checked my watch—12:38 p.m. I had four and a half hours to decide.
13:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:07,78, [13:07]HOUSTON: Congratulations from all of us here at Mission Control! Well done! What's your status? 
13:21:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:21,78," [13:21]MAV: Thanks! No health or physical problems. The rover and trailer are getting pretty worn out, but still functional. Oxygenator and Regulator both working fine. I didn't bring the Water Reclaimer. Just brought the water. Plenty of potatoes left. I'm good to last till 549. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55, Pathfinder was no longer talking to the rover. It had stopped answering pings 4 hours and 24 minutes ago. Some quick math told me that was around 13:30 today. 
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,54," At 13:30 my ruination occurred, though I didn't realize it at the time. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55," At 13:30, I leaned the drill against the workbench. The drill's cowling was off to make room for the power line. The workbench is metal. If the drill leaned against the workbench just right, it could make a metal-to-metal connection. "
13:36:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:36,78," [13:36]HOUSTON: Glad to hear it. Hermes is still on track for a Sol 549 flyby. As you know, the MAV will need to lose some weight to make the intercept. We're going to get you those procedures within the day. How much water do you have? What did you do with urine? "
13:50:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:50,78, [13:50]MAV: I have 550L of remaining water. I've been dumping urine outside along the way. 
14:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:05,78, [14:05]HOUSTON: Preserve all water. Don't do any more urine dumps. Store it somewhere. Turn the rover's radio on and leave it on. We can contact it through MAV. 
14:10:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,2:10pm.,72," Mindy trudged to her computer. Today's shift began at 2:10pm. Her schedule matched Watney's every day. She slept when he slept. Watney simply slept at night on Mars, while Mindy had to drift 40 minutes forward every day, taping aluminum foil to her windows to get any sleep at all. "
14:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:38,53, [14:38]JPL: I'm sure you're wondering how to cut a hole in the rover. 
16:03:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,16:03,46, [16:03]WATNEY: How'd the launch go? 
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,54," By 17:00, when the sun began to set, I had drilled 75 holes. A good start, but there's still tons to do. Eventually (probably tomorrow) I'll have to start drilling holes that I can't reach from the ground. For that I'll need something to stand on. "
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,55," I finished my day at 17:00 after drilling 131 holes. Not as good as yesterday, but I lost some time to the drill malfunction. "
17:08:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:08,55," [17:08] Watney: 131 holes today. 488 total. Minor drill issue; it tripped the breakers. There may be an intermittent short in the drill, probably in the attachment point of the power line. Might need to redo it. "
17:12:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:12,54, [17:12] Watney: 145 holes today. 357 total. 
17:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:31,54, [17:31] JPL: We thought you'd have more done by now. 
17:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:38,55, [17:38] Watney: Have received no reply. Last message sent 30 minutes ago. Please acknowledge. 
18:09:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,18:09,55, [18:09] Watney: system_command: STATUS

19:22:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:22,81," [19:22]JOHANSSEN: Hello, Mark. "
19:23:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:23,81, [19:23]MAV: Johanssen!? Holy crap! They finally letting you talk to me directly? 
19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81," [19:24]JOHANSSEN: Yes, NASA gave the OK for direct communication an hour ago. We're only 35 light-seconds apart, so we can talk in near-realtime. I just set up the system and I'm testing it out. "
19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81, [19:24]MAV: What took them so long to let us talk? 
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81, [19:25]JOHANSSEN: The psych team was worried about personality conflicts. 
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81, [19:25]MAV: What? Just cause you guys abandoned me on a godforsaken planet with no chance of survival? 
19:26:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:26,81, [19:26]JOHANSSEN: Funny. Don't make that kind of joke with Lewis. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81, [19:27]MAV: Roger. So uh... thanks for coming back to get me. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81, [19:27]JOHANSSEN: It's the least we could do. How is the MAV retrofit going? 
19:28:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:28,81," [19:28]MAV: So far, so good. NASA put a lot of thought into the procedures. They work. That's not to say they're easy. I spent the last 3 days removing Hull Panel 19 and the front window. Even in Mars-G they're heavy motherfuckers. "
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81," [19:29]JOHANSSEN: When we pick you up, I will make wild, passionate love to you. Prepare your body. "
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81, [19:29]JOHANSSEN: I didn't type that! That was Martinez! I stepped away from the console for like 10 seconds! 
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81, [19:29]MAV: I've really missed you guys.
