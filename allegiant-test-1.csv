We’re going to have a meeting tomorrow night, at midnight. We want you to bring your Dauntless friends”. “Okay,” I say. “Let me ask you this: If I’m going to see who you are tomorrow, why is it so important to keep this thing over my head today?"

When he finally drifts off, our fingers are twisted together in the space between the beds. I smile a little, and let myself go too. CHAPTER SIXTEEN TOBIAS THE SUN STILL hasn’t completely set when we fall asleep, but I wake a few hours later, at midnight, my mind too busy for rest, swarming with thoughts and questions and doubts.
