00:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,0:00,45," Once the clock reached -00:00:15, the television networks got what they were waiting for. The Timer Controller began the verbal countdown. “15,” She said. “14... 13... 12... 11...” "
01:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,1:00,23,"” “Give me the Mountain Dew,” he said stoically. And then I heard footsteps outside. Footsteps. We’d waited till 1:00 to turn on the lights, figuring everyone would be long asleep—it was a school night after all—but footsteps, shit, and as the Colonel looked at me confused, I grabbed the Breathalyzer from him and stuffed it between the foam cushions of the couch and grabbed the Dixie cup and the Gatorade bottle of vodka and stashed them behind the COFFEE TABLE, and in one motion I grabbed a cigarette from a pack and lit it, hoping the smell of smoke would cover up the smell of booze. I puffed the cigarette without inhaling, trying to smoke up the room, and I was almost back to the couch when the three quick knocks came against the door and the Colonel looked at me, his eyes wide, his suddenly unpromising future flashing before his eyes, and I whispered, “Cry,” as the Eagle turned the knob. The Colonel hunched forward, his head between his knees and his shoulders shaking, and I put my arm around him as the Eagle came in. “I’m sorry,” I said before the Eagle could say anything."
01:07:00,Paper Towns,John Green,1:07,4,"“Don’t I know it,” she said. 4. We were driving down a blessedly empty I-4, and I was following Margo’s directions. The clock on the dashboard said it was 1:07. “It’s pretty, huh? ” she said. She was turned away from me, staring out the window, so I could hardly see her."
01:40:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,1:40,41," By Monday, we’d mostly recovered. At least enough that we were both working at our own tables during the day (two thousand words hammered out on my end). Around 1:40, Gus held up the first note of the day: I TEXTED YOU."
01:40:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,1:40,41,"“Of course we should”. By Monday, we’d mostly recovered. At least enough that we were both working at our own tables during the day (two thousand words hammered out on my end). Around 1:40, Gus held up the first note of the day: I TEXTED YOU. I REMEMBER, I wrote back. A HISTORIC MOMENT IN OUR FRIENDSHIP. NO, he said."
01:54:00,The Lost World,Michael Crichton,1:54,12,"How long would the boat wait at the river? What time was it, anyway? He looked at his watch. The crystal was smashed, the hands fixed at 1:54. He heard the buzzing again. It was coming closer. With an effort, King pushed himself away from the seat, toward the dashboard."

Genesis 2:17"
02:35:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,2:35 A.M.,21,"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN I woke up to my phone singing a song by The Hectic Glow. Gus’s favorite. That meant he was calling—or someone was calling from his phone. I glanced at the alarm clock: 2:35 A.M. He’s gone, I thought as everything inside of me collapsed into a singularity."
02:40:00,Paper Towns,John Green,2:40,28,"It’s my car, after all, and my mission. And she says, “Really, you’re sure? ” and I say, “Yeah, yeah, I’m good to go,” and she just throws open the sliding door and lies down in the first row. Hour Twelve It is 2:40 in the morning. Lacey is sleeping. Radar is sleeping. I drive."
02:48:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,2:48 A.M.,17,"No one left behind. That said, I can’t help thinking Mom would not be happy about this. In fact, Mama Bear would be absolutely furious with the way events are unfolding today. 2:48 A.M.  I’m back where I started. Back in the ICU. My body, that is. I’ve been sitting here all along, too tired to move."
02:49:00,Paper Towns,John Green,2:49,6,"I held it up for Margo to see. She smiled, and held out her own blue finger, and then they touched, and her blue finger was pushing against mine softly and my pulse failed to slow. And then after a long time, she said, “Part Nine— downtown”. It was 2:49 in the morning. I had never, in my entire life, felt less tired. 6. Tourists never go to downtown Orlando, because there’s nothing there but a few skyscrapers owned by banks and insurance companies."
03:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,3:00,7,"Maybe you are losing your appeal,” I reply dryly. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he says in all seriousness, looking down at his watch. His smile returns. “It’s 3:00. Better get your ass home”. And with that, he hops in his car and drives off, leaving me standing in the parking lot, thinking of pissed off Russian girls and black dresses. CHAPTER 7  Nastya  I feel like I’m waiting here."
03:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,3:00,27,"“There’s nothing more we can do”. “I want to drive through it,” he said. “Like she did”. We couldn’t risk leaving campus in the middle of the night like she had, so we left about twelve hours earlier, at 3:00 in the afternoon, with the Colonel behind the wheel of Takumi’s SUV. We asked Lara and Takumi to come along, but they were tired of chasing ghosts, and besides, finals were coming. It was a bright afternoon, and the sun bore down on the asphalt so that the ribbon of road before us quivered with heat. We drove a mile down Highway 119 and then merged onto I-65 northbound, heading toward the accident scene and Vine Station."
03:06:00,Paper Towns,John Green,3:06,26,"Ben’s role is to need to pee. At first it seems like his main role is going to be complaining about how we don’t have any CDs and that all the radio stations in Orlando suck except for the college radio station, which is already out of range. But soon enough, he abandons that role for his true and faithful calling: needing to pee. “I need to pee,” he says at 3:06. We’ve been on the road for forty-three minutes. We have approximately a day left in our drive. “Well,” says Radar, “the good news is that we will be stopping."
03:10:00,Paper Towns,John Green,3:10,26,"“Well,” says Radar, “the good news is that we will be stopping. The bad news is that it won’t be for another four hours and thirty minutes”. “I think I can hold it,” Ben says. At 3:10, he announces, “Actually, I really need to pee. Really”. The chorus responds, “Hold it”. He says, “But I—” And the chorus responds again, “Hold it!"
03:15:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,3:15,28,"And I had this secret. You’ve mostly figured this out, but the truth is that I saw her that night. I’d stayed up late with Lara and some people, and then I was falling asleep and I heard her crying outside my back window. It was like 3:15 that morning, maybe, and I walked out there and saw her walking through the soccer field. I tried to talk to her, but she was in a hurry. She told me that her mother was dead eight years that day, and that she always put flowers on her mother’s grave on the anniversary, but she forgot that year. She was out there looking for flowers, but it was too early—too wintry."

03:15:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,3:15,24,"So now I’m here, on Josh Bennett’s couch at 3:15 in the afternoon, watching General Hospital. Josh spent the last commercial break patiently filling me in on as much of the past decade’s worth of storylines as he could in three and a half minutes while I ate as many Twizzlers as I could. When the commercials were over, he stopped abruptly and told me he’d tell me the rest during the next break. I don’t think I’ve spent much time actually watching the television."
03:18:00,Paper Towns,John Green,3:18 A.M.,19,"The only teenaged guy in America who dreams of sleeping with girls, and just sleeping with them. And then my phone rang. It took two more rings before my fumbling hands found the phone lying on the unrolled carpet. It was 3:18 A.M. Ben was calling. “Good morning, Ben,” I said. “YESSS! !"
03:21:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,3:21,4,"I responded: Sounds good. I’ll be at the food court. Mom drove me directly from school to the bookstore attached to the mall, where I purchased both Midnight Dawns and Requiem for Mayhem, the first two sequels to The Price of Dawn, and then I walked over to the huge food court and bought a Diet Coke. It was 3:21. I watched these kids playing in the pirate-ship indoor playground while I read. There was this tunnel that these two kids kept crawling through over and over and they never seemed to get tired, which made me think of Augustus Waters and the existentially fraught free throws. Mom was also in the food court, alone, sitting in a corner where she thought I couldn’t see her, eating a cheesesteak sandwich and reading through some papers."
03:42:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,3:42am.,43," With a relieved sigh, he sank back in his chair. Checking the clock on his computer, he shook his head. 3:42am. "
03:51:00,Paper Towns,John Green,3:51,6,"7. Sitting in the minivan with the keys in the ignition but the engine not yet started, she asked, “What time do your parents get up, by the way? ” “I don’t know, like, six-fifteen? ” It was 3:51. “I mean, we have two-plus hours and we’re through with nine parts”. “I know, but I saved the most laborious one for last. Anyway, we’ll get it all done."
04:00:00,City of Lost Souls,Cassandra Clare,4:00 a.m.,16,"""Just remember, when your mother's gnawing my ankle like a furious mama bear separated from her cub, I did it for you"". Jordan had only just fallen back asleep when the banging on the front door came again. He rolled over and groaned. The clock by the bed said 4:00 a.m. in blinking yellow numbers. More banging. Jordan rolled reluctantly to his feet, dragged on his jeans, and staggered out into the hallway. Blearily he jerked the door open."
04:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,4:00,10,"He held back my hair, cleaned up massive amounts of puke, brought me painkillers and stood over me while he forced me to drink a half-gallon of water so I wouldn’t get dehydrated. There’s nothing sunny or shiny about me, but after last night, he’s earned the right to mock me this morning. So yes, I think, at least for a little while, Josh Bennett can call me whatever the hell he likes. CHAPTER 11  Josh  At 4:00 on Sunday the doorbell rings. When I open it, I find Drew’s mom on my porch with a plastic container in her hands. “It’s Sunday. I made sauce."
04:20:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:20,5,"Through a buggy twilight, I walked to the pay phone, which was drilled into the wall between Rooms 44 and 45. On both sides of the phone, dozens of phone numbers and esoteric notes were written in pen and marker (205. 555. 1584; Tommy to airport 4:20; 773. 573. 6521; JG—Kuffs? )."
04:50:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:50,8,"“Not anymore,” Alaska said. “It’s fine. You’ll be fine”. I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle. At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner toward the classrooms."
04:50:00,Paper Towns,John Green,4:50,8,"Crap molded into seashells, key rings, glass turtles, Florida-shaped refrigerator magnets, plastic pink flamingos, whatever. In fact, there were several stores on I-Drive that sold actual, literal armadillo crap—$4. 95 a bag. But at 4:50 in the morning, the tourists were sleeping. The Drive was completely dead, like everything else, as we drove past store after parking lot after store after parking lot. “SeaWorld is just past the parkway,” Margo said. She was in the wayback of the minivan again, rifling through a backpack or something."
04:56:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,4:56,1,"5 episodes of ANTM I’d be missing. I went to Support Group for the same reason that I’d once allowed nurses with a mere eighteen months of graduate education to poison me with exotically named chemicals: I wanted to make my parents happy. There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you’re sixteen, and that’s having a kid who bites it from cancer. Mom pulled into the circular driveway behind the church at 4:56. I pretended to fiddle with my oxygen tank for a second just to kill time. “Do you want me to carry it in for you? ”  “No, it’s fine,” I said."
04:56:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:56,8,"You’ll be fine”. I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4:56, plus the Eagle. At 4:58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner toward the classrooms. I never saw anything like it. Takumi wore a starched white shirt with a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie."
04:57:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,4:57 A.M.,19,"How sometimes I didn’t understand why I’d been drawn to it, how some days it seemed as if the instrument had chosen me. I nodded, smiled, and returned my attention to the game. “King me,” I said. 4:57 A.M.  I can’t stop thinking about “Waiting for Vengeance”. It’s been years since I’ve listened to or thought of that song, but after Gramps left my bedside, I’ve been singing it to myself over and over. Dad wrote the song ages ago, but now it feels like he wrote it yesterday. Like he wrote it from wherever he is."
04:58:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:58,8,"I didn’t start to worry until it got to be 4:50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for.

Takumi wore a starched white shirt with a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie. They walked in step, heads up and shoulders back, like some kind of action-movie heroes."
04:59:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,4:59,1,". . well. I pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would display the time: 4:59. The circle filled in with the unlucky twelve-to-eighteens, and then Patrick started us out with the serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. The guy was still staring at me. I felt rather blushy."
05:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,5:00 A.M.,29,"” The tiny voice shrill and squeaky, but he got the rules down, and quickly. And that’s how it began. 44 HERE’S A TYPICAL day in the atypical new reality of Camp Haven. 5:00 A.M.: Reveille and wash up. Dress and prep bunks for inspection. 5:10 A.M.: Fall in. Reznik inspects our billets."
05:00:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth,5:00,9,"But she doesn’t fall. She grabs the bars of the barrier. Her fingers slide down the metal until I can’t see her head anymore; they are all I see. Al’s watch reads 5:00. “Five minutes are up,” he says, almost spitting the words at Eric. Eric checks his own watch. Taking his time, tilting his wrist, all while my stomach twists and I can’t breathe."
05:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,5:00 a.m.,19,"He stretched sleepily, winced in pain, and sat up. Soft yellow light came through the side windows. It was morning: he had slept the whole night! He looked quickly at his watch: 5:00 a.m. Still almost six hours to go before the boat had to be recalled. He rolled onto his back, groaning. His head throbbed, and his body ached as if he had been beaten up. From around the corner, he heard a squeaking sound, like a rusty wheel."
05:10:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,5:10 A.M.,29,44 HERE’S A TYPICAL day in the atypical new reality of Camp Haven. 5:00 A.M.: Reveille and wash up. Dress and prep bunks for inspection. 5:10 A.M.: Fall in. Reznik inspects our billets. Finds a wrinkle in someone’s sheet. Screams for twenty minutes.
05:30:00,An Abundance of Katherines,John Green,5:30 A.M.,12,"Lindsey will accompany you. See you tonight. Hollis. P.S. I’m writing this note at 5:30 A.M., so don’t wake me up. “Nice bedhead, by the way, kafir. You look like you stuck a fork in a light socket”. “Did you know that in 1887, Nikola Tesla’s hair stood on end for an entire week after he passed fifty thousand volts through his body to prove that elec—” “Kafir,” Hassan said, putting his fork down on his plate."
05:42:00,Paper Towns,John Green,5:42,9,"“I’ll download the pic when we get home and then give it back to you at school? ” I asked. I still wanted her to say, Yes, at school, where things will be different, where I will be your friend in public, and also decidedly single, but she just said, “Yeah, or whenever”. It was 5:42 when I turned into Jefferson Park. We drove down Jefferson Drive to Jefferson Court and then turned onto our road, Jefferson Way. I killed the headlights one last time and idled up my driveway. I didn’t know what to say, and Margo wasn’t saying anything."
05:42:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,5:42 A.M.,21,"“I’m kidding”. “Good,” I said. “Sort of,” he added. 5:42 A.M.  Adam is gone. He suddenly rushed out, calling to Nurse Ramirez that he’d forgotten something important and would be back as soon as he could. He was already out the door when she told him that she was about to get off work. In fact, she just left, but not before making sure to inform the nurse who’d relieved Old Grumpy that “the young man with the skinny pants and messy hair” is allowed to see me when he returns."
05:45:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,5:45,14,"Margot knows I have nothing to do and Drew isn’t about to give me a chance to get out of it anyway. He’s on his feet in an instant, bolting before the plans can be rescinded. “Dinner’s at six. I’ll pick you up at 5:45. Dress nice. My mom likes to pretend we’re civilized once a week”. He smiles conspiratorially in Margot’s direction."
05:45:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,5:45,21,"Does she talk to other people and she’s lying to me? I don’t know why, but that bothers me. A lot. “She wrote down this address under the words Drop off, Sunday and 5:45. At the bottom she tacked on the word please. It’s the most communication I’ve gotten from her in years”. She sounds aggravated at having to explain herself to me."
05:55:00,Paper Towns,John Green,5:55,9,"I’d been asleep for just about thirty minutes when my alarm clock went off at 6:32. But I did not personally notice that my alarm clock was going off for seventeen minutes, not until I felt hands on my shoulders and heard the distant voice of my mother saying, “Good morning, sleepyhead”. “Uhh,” I responded. I felt significantly more tired than I had back at 5:55, and I would have skipped school, except I had perfect attendance, and while I realized that perfect attendance is not particularly impressive or even necessarily admirable, I wanted to keep the streak alive. Plus, I wanted to see how Margo would act around me. When I walked into the kitchen, Dad was telling Mom something while they ate at the breakfast counter. Dad paused when he saw me and said, “How’d you sleep?"
06:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,6:00,13,"I was greedy for it, desperate for whatever words he had left to give me, even if they were delivered through a drug-addled haze. He told me a lot of things that night and I remember them all. There was talk of women and unforgiveable things, porch swings and red brick houses and memories that didn’t exist yet. ***  I have to be at Drew’s for dinner at 6:00 which means I need to get in the shower now and find some better clothes to put on. Drew’s mom likes it when you dress for Sunday dinner. It’s not any fancy thing, but according to Mrs. Leighton, dressing nicely makes it special, so that’s what we do. I tried to get out of going, but she wouldn’t let me."
06:10:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,6:10,40,"***  “Sunshine? We’re here”. I open my eyes and look at the clock on the dashboard. 6:10. Seriously, Josh. What the hell? “Where are we?"
06:13:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,6:13am,45," Bruce Ng sat in the JPL cafeteria along with hundreds of engineers who had given everything they had to Iris. They watched the large TV with rapt attention. It was 6:13am in Pasadena, yet every single employee was present. "
06:30:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,6:30 A.M.,29,"The frozen ground beneath our boots. Our breaths frosting in the air. The twin columns of black smoke from the power plant rising beyond the airfield and the rumble of buses pulling out of the main gate. 6:30 A.M.: Chow in the crowded mess hall that smells faintly like soured milk, reminding me of the plague and the fact that once upon a time I thought about just three things—cars, football, and girls, in that order. I help Nugget with his tray, urging him to eat because, if he doesn’t eat, boot camp will kill him. Those are my exact words: Boot camp will kill you. Tank and Flintstone laugh at me mothering Nugget."
06:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,6:30,13,"They still stored hay there, although I don’t know what for. It wasn’t like we had an equestrian program or anything. The Colonel, Takumi, and I got there first, setting up our sleeping bags on the softest bales of hay. It was 6:30. Alaska came shortly after, having told the Eagle she was spending the weekend with Jake. The Eagle didn’t check that story, because Alaska spent at least one weekend there every month, and he knew that her parents never cared. Lara showed up half an hour later."
06:32:00,Paper Towns,John Green,6:32,9,"She jimmied her window open and crawled inside. I walked through my unlocked front door, tiptoed through the kitchen to my bedroom, peeled off my jeans, threw them into a corner of the closet back near the window screen, downloaded the picture of Jase, and got into bed, my mind booming with the things I would say to her at school. PART TWO The Grass 10. I’d been asleep for just about thirty minutes when my alarm clock went off at 6:32. But I did not personally notice that my alarm clock was going off for seventeen minutes, not until I felt hands on my shoulders and heard the distant voice of my mother saying, “Good morning, sleepyhead”. “Uhh,” I responded.

06:40:00,The Lost World,Michael Crichton,6:40,13,"The others remained where they were. Waiting. He looked around, realized it was getting dark. He looked at his watch: 6:40. There were only a few minutes more of daylight. Beneath the jungle canopy, it was already quite dark. He had to get to safety, and soon."
07:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,7:00,2,"You can't miss your schedule. Every morning, you're supposed to stick your right arm in this contraption in the wall. It tattoos the smooth inside of your forearm with your schedule for the day in a sickly purple ink. 7:00 - Breakfast. 7:30 - Kitchen Duties. 8:30 - Education Center, Room 17. And so on."
07:02:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,7:02 AM.,2,"“Ice cream? ” she asks, sounding like she might need it more than me. I smile back, because even at 10:30 in the morning, there’s only one answer to that question. CHAPTER 2  Josh  Monday, 7:02 AM. Pointless. That’s what today is going to be, along with the 179 school days that come after it. I’d contemplate the waste of it all now if I had the time, but I don’t."
07:09:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,7:09 A.M.,1,"7:09 A.M.  Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in a way, I suppose that’s true. I wake up this morning to a thin blanket of white covering our front lawn. It isn’t even an inch, but in this part of Oregon a slight dusting brings everything to a standstill as the one snowplow in the county gets busy clearing the roads."
07:16:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,7:16 A.M.,22,"So I played. And even though you wouldn’t think it, the cello didn’t sound half bad with all those guitars. In fact, it sounded pretty amazing. 7:16 A.M.  It’s morning. And inside the hospital, there’s a different kind of dawn, a rustling of covers, a clearing of the eyes. In some ways, the hospital never goes to sleep. The lights stay on and the nurses stay awake, but even though it’s still dark outside, you can tell that things are waking up."
07:17:00,Paper Towns,John Green,7:17,1,"And in everything that came afterward, I could never stop thinking that maybe she loved mysteries so much that she became one. PART ONE  The  Strings  1 . The longest day of my life began tardily. I woke up late, took too long in the shower, and ended up having to enjoy my breakfast in the passenger seat of my mom’s minivan at 7:17 that Wednesday morning. I usually got a ride to school with my best friend, Ben Starling, but Ben had gone to school on time, making him useless to me. “On time” for us was thirty minutes before school actually started, because the half hour before the first bell was the highlight of our social calendars: standing outside the side door that led into the band room and just talking. Most of my friends were in band, and most of my free time during school was spent within twenty feet of the band room."
07:25:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth,7:25,1,"But now they make me a target. I pause by a window in the E Wing and wait for the Dauntless to arrive. I do this every morning. At exactly 7:25, the Dauntless prove their bravery by jumping from a moving train. My father calls the Dauntless “hellions”. They are pierced, tattooed, and black-clothed. Their primary purpose is to guard the fence that surrounds our city."
07:30:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,7:30,17,"I don't know that we're actually friends, but possibly the wordallies would be accurate. That's good. I'm going to need an ally. The next morning, when we report for training at 7:30, reality slaps me in the face. We've been funneled into a class of relative beginners, fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds, which seems a little insulting until it's obvious that they're in far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different, accelerated phase of training. After we stretch - which hurts - there's a couple of hours of strengthening exercises - which hurt - and a five-mile run - which kills."

07:30:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,7:30 A.M.,29,"The top four squads will graduate at the end of November, and the competition is fierce. Our squad’s been stuck in tenth place for weeks. Tenth isn’t bad, but it’s not good enough. 7:30 A.M.: Training. Weapons. Hand-to-hand. Basic wilderness survival."
07:32:00,Paper Towns,John Green,7:32,15,"And I’ll check up on you this afternoon, okay? ” I nodded, and then pulled the covers back up to my chin. Even though the bucket had been cleaned, I could smell the puke underneath the detergent, and the smell of it reminded me of the act of puking, which for some reason made me want to puke again, but I just took slow, even mouth breaths until I heard the Chrysler backing down the driveway. It was 7:32. For once, I thought, I would be on time. Not to school, admittedly. But still."

CHAPTER 24  Nastya  When I get to his house at 7:40, Josh is in his driveway, leaning against the side of his truck. As soon as he sees me, he unlocks the doors and comes around to open mine. “About time, Sunshine,” he says. “I was about to give up on you”."
07:40:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green,7:40,23,"After a while, I got up and went to my room to write about Augustus. Both Mom and Dad tried a few times to knock on the door or whatever, but I just told them I was doing something important. It took me forever to figure out what I wanted to say, and even then I wasn’t very happy with it. Before I’d technically finished, I noticed it was 7:40, which meant that I would be late even if I didn’t change, so in the end I wore baby blue cotton pajama pants, flip-flops, and Gus’s Butler shirt. I walked out of the room and tried to go right past them, but my dad said, “You can’t leave the house without permission”. “Oh, my God, Dad. He wanted me to write him a eulogy, okay?"
07:52:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,7:52,4,"I went to bed wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and socks. No matter how miserably hot it got, I resolved, I would sleep in my clothes every night at the Creek, feeling—probably for the first time in my life—the fear and excitement of living in a place where you never know what’s going to happen or when. one hundred twenty-six days before “WELL, NOW IT’S WAR,” the Colonel shouted the next morning. I rolled over and looked at the clock: 7:52. My first Culver Creek class, French, started in eighteen minutes. I blinked a couple times and looked up at the Colonel, who was standing between the couch and the COFFEE TABLE, holding his well-worn, once-white tennis shoes by the laces. For a long time, he stared at me, and I stared at him."
08:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:00,17,"But it worked well enough. The Eagle tore out of his house as soon as the first string of firecrackers started popping—he was waiting for us, I suppose—and we headed for the woods and got him in deeply enough that he never heard her drive away. The Colonel and I doubled back, wading through the creek to save time, slipped in through the back window of Room 43, and slept like babies. after the day after THE COLONEL SLEPT the not-restful sleep of the drunk, and I lay on my back on the bottom bunk, my mouth tingling and alive as if still kissing, and we would have likely slept through our morning classes had the Eagle not awoken us at 8:00 with three quick knocks. I rolled over as he opened the door, and the morning light rushed into the room. “I need y’all to go to the gym,” he said. I squinted toward him, the Eagle himself backlit into invisibility by the too bright sun."
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,30, Earth is about to set. Resume 08:00 my time tomorrow morning. Tell family I’m fine. Give crew my best. Tell Commander Lewis disco sucks. 
08:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:00,31," Today I got up hours earlier than I needed to. It was like Christmas morning! I could hardly wait for 08:00 to roll around. I had breakfast, did some unnecessary checks on Hab equipment, and read some Poirot. Finally the time came! "

All around him, the control room was strewn with paper plates and half-eaten sandwiches. Arnold was exhausted. It was 8:00 a.m. on Saturday. In the fourteen hours since Nedry destroyed the computer that ran Jurassic Park, Arnold had patiently pulled systems back on line, one after another. ""All the park systems are back, and functioning correctly. The phones are working."

08:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:02,43," [08:02]JPL: We've spun up a project to get you food. It's been in progress for a week or so. We can get it to you before you starve, but it'll be tight. It'll just be food and a radio. We can't send an Oxygenator, Water Reclaimer, or any of that other stuff without powered descent. "
08:05:00,Insurgent,Veronica Roth,8:05,24,“This is exactly what I mean. You’re far more perceptive than most”. He checks his watch. “They told me to catch the one leaving at 8:05. Come on”. I feel a surge of hope. Maybe we won’t argue this time.
08:10:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:10,4,"And then we need to go ahead and start thinking about how we’re going to ruin their miserable little lives”. When I received the Culver Creek Handbook over the summer and noticed happily that the “Dress Code” section contained only two words, casual modesty, it never occurred to me that girls would show up for class half asleep in cotton pajama shorts, T-shirts, and flip-flops. Modest, I guess, and casual. And there was something about girls wearing pajamas (even if modest), which might have made French at 8:10 in the morning bearable, if I’d had any idea what Madame O’Malley was talking about. Comment dis-tu “Oh my God, I don’t know nearly enough French to pass French II” en franCais? My French I class back in Florida did not prepare me for Madame O’Malley, who skipped the “how was your summer” pleasantries and dove directly into something called the passé composé, which is apparently a verb tense. Alaska sat directly across from me in the circle of desks, but she didn’t look at me once the entire class, even though I could notice little but her."

08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,44," [08:16]JPL: A little behind schedule, but we'll get it done. In the mean time, we want you to get back to work. We're satisfied the Hab's is in good condition. Maintenance only takes you 12 hours per week. We're going to pack the rest of your time with research and experiments. "
08:16:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:16,43," [08:16]WATNEY: No complaints here! You get me the food, I'll be a happy camper. I've got all Hab systems up and running again. The Water Reclaimer is working fine now that I replaced the burst hoses. As for water supply, I have 620L remaining. I started with 900L (300 to start with, 600 more from reducing hydrazine). So I lost almost 300L to sublimation. Still, with the Water Reclaimer operational again, it's plenty. "

He likes to drive now."
08:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:25,42, [08:25]JPL: Received! You gave us quite a scare there. Thanks for the “A-OK” message. Our analysis of satellite imagery shows a complete detachment of Airlock 1. Is that correct? What’s your status? Include your personal health and Hab equipment.

08:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,8:30,10,"There are times when it is appropriate, even preferable, to get an erection when someone’s face is in close proximity to your penis. This was not one of those times. So I stopped thinking about the layers and the warmth, muted the TV, and focused on Decapitation. At 8:30, I turned off the game and scooted out from underneath Alaska. She turned onto her back, still asleep, the lines of my corduroy pants imprinted on her cheek. I usually only called my parents on Sunday afternoons, so when my mom heard my voice, she instantly overreacted. “What’s wrong, Miles?"
08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,44, [08:31]WATNEY: Great! I'm sick of sitting on my ass. I'm going to be here for years. You may as well make use of me.

08:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:31,43," [08:31]JPL: Good, keep us posted on any mechanical or electronic problems. By the way, the name of the probe we're sending is “Iris”. Named after the Greek goddess who traveled the heavens with the speed of wind. She's also the goddess of rainbows. "
08:39:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:39,42," [08:39]WATNEY: If by “detachment” you mean “shot me out like a cannon” then yeah. Minor cut on my forehead. Had some issues with my EVA suit (I’ll explain later). I patched up the Hab and repressurized it (main air tanks were intact). I just got power back online. Primary air and water tanks were unharmed. The rover, solar array, and Pathfinder were out of blast range. I’ll run diagnostics on the Hab’s systems while I wait for your next reply. By the way, who am I talking to? "

08:45:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:45,54," I started my EVA around 08:45, same as always. I got my hammer and screwdriver and started chipping the trailer's hull. It's a pain in the ass to make a chip before each drilling, so I make all the day's chips in a single go. "
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,43, [08:47]WATNEY: Gay probe coming to save me. Got it. 
08:47:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:47,44," [08:47]JPL: That's what we're thinking. We'll get you a schedule as soon as the science team puts it together. It'll be mostly of EVAs, geological samples, soil tests, and weekly self-administered medical tests. Honestly, this is the best “bonus Mars time” we've had since the Opportunity lander. "
08:52:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,8:52,42," [08:52]JPL: Venkat Kapoor, in Houston. Pasadena relays my messages. I'm going to handle all direct communication with you from now on. Check the Oxygenator and Water Reclaimer first. They’re the most important. "
09:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,9:00 A.M.,16,"“You’ll be fine”. He finished, stood up, and said, “I finally found something that can stop the fox. The fox cannot summit Strawberry Hill”. Alaska and Lara walked to their rooms, planning to check in with the Eagle later in the day, while Takumi and I stood behind the Colonel as he knocked on the Eagle’s door at 9:00 A.M. “Y’all are home early. Have fun? ” “Yes sir,” the Colonel said. “How’s your mom, Chip?"
09:02:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:02,44, [09:02]WATNEY: Opportunity never went back to Earth. 
09:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:05,42, [09:05]WATNEY: Duh. Oxygenator functioning perfectly. Water Reclaimer is completely offline. Best guess is water froze up inside and burst some tubing. I’m sure I can fix it. Hab’s main computer also functioning without any problems. Any idea what caused the Hab to blow up?

09:18:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:18,42," [09:18]JPL: Best guess is fatigue on the canvas near Airlock 1. The pressurization cycle stressed it until it failed. From now on, alternate Airlock 2 and 3 for all EVAs. Also, we’ll be getting you a checklist and procedures for a full canvas exam. "

That’s the moment I push my feet hard and fast in the opposite direction. And I run far away from Corinthian Way and my absurd, self-destructive thoughts. I get back to Margot’s house at 9:25 and head straight for the shower. I talk more to myself in that shower than I have in months. Within the safety of an empty house, under the muting of the running water, I remind myself of all the complications that will come from opening my mouth.

09:55:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,9:55,79," [09:55]HOUSTON: Admittedly, they are very invasive modifications, but they have to be done. The procedure doc we sent has instructions for each of these steps with tools you have on hand. Also, you'll need to start electrolyzing water to get the hydrogen for the fuel plant. We'll send you procedures for that shortly. "

Get a chest tube in her and move her out! ” the nice red-haired medic screams as she passes me off to a team of nurses and doctors."
10:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,10:25,53," [10:25] JPL: Glad to hear it. Starting on the cut sounds great. Just to be clear, these are modifications to Rover 1, which we've been calling “the trailer.” Rover 2 (the one with your modifications for the trip to Pathfinder) should remain as-is for now. "

And that is pretty much what they did, pausing only to turn out the lights at 11:00 so the Eagle wouldn’t drop by. They chatted some, but mostly they drank, and I drifted out of the conversation and ended up squinting through the dark, looking at the book spines in Alaska’s Life Library. Even minus the books she’d lost in the mini-flood, I could have stayed up until morning reading through the haphazard stacks of titles. A dozen white tulips in a plastic vase were precariously perched atop one of the book stacks, and when I asked her about them, she just said, “Jake and my’s anniversary,” and I didn’t care to continue that line of dialogue, so I went back to scanning titles, and I was just wondering how I could go about learning Edgar Allan Poe’s last words (for the record: “Lord help my poor soul”) when I heard Alaska say, “Pudge isn’t even listening to us”."

11:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:00,3,"I decided to heed what I’m sure would have been my mother’s advice and get a good night’s sleep before my first day of classes. French II started at 8:10, and figuring it couldn’t take more than eight minutes to put on some clothes and walk to the classrooms, I set my alarm for 8:02. I took a shower, and then lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me from the heat. Around 11:00, I realized that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might make more of a difference if I took off my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top of the sheets wearing just boxers. A decision I found myself regretting some hours later when I awoke to two sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy hell out of me. I woke up completely and instantly, sitting up straight in bed, terrified, and I couldn’t understand the voices for some reason, couldn’t understand why there were any voices at all, and what the hell time was it anyway? And finally my head cleared enough to hear, “C’mon, kid."
11:03:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:03,4,"I didn’t know anyone and couldn’t even figure out whom I should be trying to know, and the classes were hard, even on the first day. My dad had told me I’d have to study, and now I believed him. The teachers were serious and smart and a lot of them went by “Dr.,” and so when the time came for my last class before lunch, World Religions, I felt tremendous relief. A vestige from when Culver Creek was a Christian boys’ school, I figured the World Religions class, required of every junior and senior, might be an easy A. It was my only class all day where the desks weren’t arranged either in a square or a circle, so, not wanting to seem eager, I sat down in the third row at 11:03. I was seven minutes early, partly because I liked to be punctual, and partly because I didn’t have anyone to chat with out in the halls. Shortly thereafter, the Colonel came in with Takumi, and they sat down on opposite sides of me. “I heard about last night,” Takumi said."

11:40:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,11:40,26,"But the Creek was rife with gossips—particularly the Weekday Warriors, and if just one person told one friend who told one friend who told one friend who told the Eagle, everything would fall apart. The Creek’s don’t-rat ethos withstood the test nicely, but when Maxx/Stan/Dr. Morse didn’t shown up by 11:50 that morning, I thought the Colonel would lose his shit. He sat on the bumper of a car in the student parking lot, his head bowed, his hands running through his thick mop of dark hair over and over again, as if he were trying to find something in there. Maxx had promised to arrive by 11:40, twenty minutes before the official start of Speaker Day, giving him time to learn the speech and everything. I stood next to the Colonel, worried but quiet, waiting.

Then I use the dry-erase marker to draw a long line from the center toward the twelve and a short line from the center to the two. I’d rather sleep a solid eight hours, but I don’t want to keep Rocky waiting too long. I’ll settle for a two-hour nap. “I’ll come back when the clock matches this,” I say. As if that would help him understand."
12:04:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:04,32," [12:04]JPL: We’ll get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double-check your work. Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure. Sol 900 is great news. It’ll give us a lot more time to get the supply mission together. Also, please watch your language. Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world. "
12:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:07,54, [12:07] Watney: That's what she said. 
12:13:00,Paper Towns,John Green,12:13,28,"“Yeah, then we should probably just open another bottle of Bluefin”. And so we do. Hour Ten It is time for our second stop. It is 12:13 in the morning. My fingers do not feel like they are made of fingers; they feel like they are made of motion. I am tickling the steering wheel as I drive. After Radar finds the nearest BP on his handheld, we decide to wake up Lacey and Ben."

12:19:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,12:19 P.M.,4,"My eyes flickered upward. Adam was there waiting for me. That was how it started. 12:19 P.M.  There are a lot of things wrong with me. Apparently, I have a collapsed lung. A ruptured spleen. Internal bleeding of unknown origin."
12:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,12:25,54," [12:25] JPL: Seriously, Mark? Seriously? "
12:30:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:30,107," I came to the meeting on time. At least, I thought I did. The email said 12:30. But when I got there, everyone was already seated. And silent. And they were all staring at me."
12:30:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,12:30,7,"It takes no time to slip on a pair of running shorts and a t-shirt and throw on my shoes. My feet love me again. I glance at the clock. 12:30. I hook a canister of pepper spray onto my hip and grip the kubotan that holds my keys in my right hand, even though it’s annoying as all hell to run with. It’s my security blanket. Clutched in my fingers, offering me the illusion of a security that doesn’t exist."
12:30:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,12:30,12,"She looked at it for a moment, then handed me a white one and a lighter. We spent all morning burning candles—well, and occasionally lighting cigarettes off the burning candles after we stuffed a towel into the crack at the bottom of her door. Over the course of two hours, we added a full foot to the summit of her polychrome candle volcano. “Mount St. Helens on acid,” she said At 12:30, after two hours of me begging for a ride to McDonald’s, Alaska decided it was time for lunch. As we began to walk to the student parking lot, I saw a strange car. A small green car. A hatchback."
12:38:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,12:38 p.m.,109, I checked my watch—12:38 p.m. I had four and a half hours to decide.
12:49:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,12:49,74,"Everywhere were instruments of curious design: a galvanometer for measuring electrical currents, a torsion balance machine, and a clockwork orrery of gold, bronze, and silver—a gift from Charlotte to Henry some years ago. A dozen different microscopes, astrolabes, retorts, and measuring devices were scattered across the table and cabinet tops. On a plinth rested the Colt Single Action army revolver Christopher and Henry had been working on for months before all this had happened. Its river-gray nickel plating was deeply engraved with runes and a curving inscription: LUKE 12:49."
12:49:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,12:49,38, —Luke 12:49–51
12:49:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,12:49,43," “Don’t wave it about, Tom, even if it isn’t working,” James warned, and Thomas handed the revolver quickly to James. James examined it, taking care to keep the muzzle pointed at the wall, away from the others. The gun was heavier than he had expected, its river-gray barrel etched with the inscription LUKE 12:49."
12:49:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,12:49,44," As he set out for home, he thought of the inscription on the barrel of the gun—LUKE 12:49. He knew the Biblical verse; any Shadowhunter would."
13:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,1:00 P.M.,29,"Nugget stares at his burger like it might jump off his plate and bite his face. Thanks, Dumbo. The kid’s skinny enough as it is. 1:00 P.M.: More training. Mostly on the firing range. Nugget is issued a stick for a rifle and fires pretend rounds while we fire real ones into life-size plywood cutouts. The crack of the M16s."
13:07:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:07,78, [13:07]HOUSTON: Congratulations from all of us here at Mission Control! Well done! What's your status? 
13:21:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:21,78," [13:21]MAV: Thanks! No health or physical problems. The rover and trailer are getting pretty worn out, but still functional. Oxygenator and Regulator both working fine. I didn't bring the Water Reclaimer. Just brought the water. Plenty of potatoes left. I'm good to last till 549. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,54," At 13:30 my ruination occurred, though I didn't realize it at the time. "
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55, Pathfinder was no longer talking to the rover. It had stopped answering pings 4 hours and 24 minutes ago. Some quick math told me that was around 13:30 today. 
13:30:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:30,55," At 13:30, I leaned the drill against the workbench. The drill's cowling was off to make room for the power line. The workbench is metal. If the drill leaned against the workbench just right, it could make a metal-to-metal connection. "
13:36:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:36,78," [13:36]HOUSTON: Glad to hear it. Hermes is still on track for a Sol 549 flyby. As you know, the MAV will need to lose some weight to make the intercept. We're going to get you those procedures within the day. How much water do you have? What did you do with urine? "
13:50:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,13:50,78, [13:50]MAV: I have 550L of remaining water. I've been dumping urine outside along the way. 
14:05:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:05,78, [14:05]HOUSTON: Preserve all water. Don't do any more urine dumps. Store it somewhere. Turn the rover's radio on and leave it on. We can contact it through MAV. 
14:10:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,2:10pm.,72," Mindy trudged to her computer. Today's shift began at 2:10pm. Her schedule matched Watney's every day. She slept when he slept. Watney simply slept at night on Mars, while Mindy had to drift 40 minutes forward every day, taping aluminum foil to her windows to get any sleep at all. "
14:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,14:38,53, [14:38]JPL: I'm sure you're wondering how to cut a hole in the rover. 
15:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,15:00,12,"Push our lunch around our bowls. Blow things up on the shooting range. Because of the danger of detection, no communication comes from the rescue team. At 15:00, the designated hour, we stand tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens and computers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate the airwaves. His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with a determination I have never seen. Most of my interview doesn't make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and still defiant. It is Finnick's salacious and gory account of the Capitol that takes the day."
15:47:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,3:47 P.M.,5,"Normally, he was a handshaker, maybe a back-patter on really special occasions. His hug was strong and tight, and I knew it was his way of telling me that he’d had a wonderful time. “Me, too, Gramps,” I whispered. 3:47 P.M.  They just moved me out of the recovery room into the trauma intensive-care unit, or ICU. It’s a horseshoe-shaped room with about a dozen beds and a cadre of nurses, who constantly bustle around, reading the computer printouts that churn out from the feet of our beds recording our vital signs. In the middle of the room are more computers and a big desk, where another nurse sits. I have two nurses who check in on me, along with the endless round of doctors."
16:03:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,16:03,46, [16:03]WATNEY: How'd the launch go? 
16:39:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,4:39 P.M.,6,"“That’s a relief. I thought you might just be using me for sex,” he joked, smiling. After that, we still had our problems, but being overly polite with each other wasn’t one of them. 4:39 P.M.  I have quite the crowd now. Gran and Gramps. Uncle Greg. Aunt Diane."
16:47:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,4:47 P.M.,7,"Even if we had owned up to the prank—as we’d planned to if anyone else got in trouble—we’d have had a hard time convincing anyone it really was us. This always made Kim laugh. “People believe what they want to believe,” she said. 4:47 P.M.  Mom once snuck me into a casino. We were going on vacation to Crater Lake and we stopped at a resort on an Indian reservation for the buffet lunch. Mom decided to do a bit of gambling, and I went with her while Dad stayed with Teddy, who was napping in his stroller. Mom sat down at the dollar blackjack tables."
16:56:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,4:56 P.M.,1,"She cooked a small mountain of artichoke dip. She festooned our living room in green and yellow streamers, the colors of my new school. She bought two dozen champagne poppers and placed them around the edge of our coffee table. And when that final Friday came, when my packing was mostly done, she sat with my dad and me on the living-room couch at 4:56 P.M. and patiently awaited the arrival of the Good-bye to Miles Cavalry. Said cavalry consisted of exactly two people: Marie Law-son, a tiny blonde with rectangular glasses, and her chunky (to put it charitably) boyfriend, Will. “Hey, Miles,” Marie said as she sat down. “Hey,” I said."
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,55," I finished my day at 17:00 after drilling 131 holes. Not as good as yesterday, but I lost some time to the drill malfunction. "
17:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:00,54," By 17:00, when the sun began to set, I had drilled 75 holes. A good start, but there's still tons to do. Eventually (probably tomorrow) I'll have to start drilling holes that I can't reach from the ground. For that I'll need something to stand on. "
17:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,5:00 P.M.,29,"Poundcake earns a perfect score; I’m the worst shot in the squad. I pretend the cutout is Reznik, hoping that will improve my aim. It doesn’t. 5:00 P.M.: Evening chow. Canned meat, canned peas, canned fruit. Nugget pushes his food around and then bursts into tears. The squad glares at me."
17:08:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:08,55," [17:08] Watney: 131 holes today. 488 total. Minor drill issue; it tripped the breakers. There may be an intermittent short in the drill, probably in the attachment point of the power line. Might need to redo it. "
17:12:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:12,54, [17:12] Watney: 145 holes today. 357 total. 
17:30:00,Twilight,Stephenie Meyer,5:30 p.m.,7,"
If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie."
17:31:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:31,54, [17:31] JPL: We thought you'd have more done by now. 
17:35:00,Paper Towns,John Green,5:35 P.M.,27,"And Lacey and Ben repeat it also. “Six minutes”. “Six minutes”. At 5:35 P.M., with nine hundred miles to go, Radar informs us that, according to his handheld, the next exit will have a BP. As I pull into the gas station, Lacey and Radar are crouched behind the sliding door in the back. Ben, seat belt unbuckled, has one hand on the passenger-door handle and the other on the dashboard. I maintain as much speed as I can for as long as I can, and then slam on the brakes right in front of the gas tank."
17:38:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,17:38,55, [17:38] Watney: Have received no reply. Last message sent 30 minutes ago. Please acknowledge. 
17:40:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,5:40 P.M.,8,"I was excited about a baby. And I knew that Carnegie Hall wasn’t going anywhere. I’d get there someday. 5:40 P.M.  I am a little freaked out right now. Gran and Gramps left a while ago, but I stayed behind here in the ICU. I am sitting in one the chairs, going over their conversation, which was very nice and normal and nondisturbing. Until they left."
18:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,6:00 P.M.,29,"About how she promised to come for him. I wonder why the commander would stick a little kid who can’t even lift a rifle into our squad. If Wonderland winnowed out the best fighters, what sort of profile did this little guy produce? 6:00 P.M.: Drill instructor Q&A in the barracks, my favorite part of the day, where I get to spend some quality time with my favorite person in the whole wide world. After informing us what worthless piles of desiccated rat feces we are, Reznik opens the floor for questions and concerns. Most of our questions have to do with the competition. Rules, procedures in case of a tie, rumors about this or that squad cheating."
18:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,18:00,4,"I make my way up to the top floor and find Compartment E. It looks exactly like Compartment 307, except for the window - two feet wide, eight inches high - centered at the top of the outside wall. There's a heavy metal plate that fastens over it, but right now it's propped open, and a certain cat is nowhere to be seen. I stretch out on my bed, and a shaft of afternoon sunlight plays on my face. The next thing I know, my sister is waking me for 18:00 - Reflection . Prim tells me they've been announcing the assembly since lunch. The entire population, except those needed for essential jobs, is required to attend. We follow directions to the Collective, a huge room that easily holds the thousands who show up."

We're heading down to the dining hall for 18:30 - Dinner when Gale's communicuff begins to beep. It looks like an oversized watch, but it receives print messages. Being granted a communicuff is a special privilege that's reserved for those important to the cause, a status Gale achieved by his rescue of the citizens of 12.

19:13:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,7:13 P.M.,10,"After that, whenever I started to doubt Adam’s feelings, I’d think about my wig, gathering dust in my closet, and it would bring back the memory of that night. And then I wouldn’t feel insecure. I’d just feel lucky. 7:13 P.M.  He’s here. I have been hanging out in an empty hospital room in the maternity ward, wanting to be far away from my relatives and even farther away from the ICU and that nurse, or more specifically what that nurse said and what I now understand. I needed to be somewhere where people wouldn’t be sad, where the thoughts concerned life, not death. So I came here, the land of screaming babies."

19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81," [19:24]JOHANSSEN: Yes, NASA gave the OK for direct communication an hour ago. We're only 35 light-seconds apart, so we can talk in near-realtime. I just set up the system and I'm testing it out. "
19:24:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:24,81, [19:24]MAV: What took them so long to let us talk? 
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81, [19:25]JOHANSSEN: The psych team was worried about personality conflicts. 
19:25:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:25,81, [19:25]MAV: What? Just cause you guys abandoned me on a godforsaken planet with no chance of survival? 
19:26:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:26,81, [19:26]JOHANSSEN: Funny. Don't make that kind of joke with Lewis. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81, [19:27]MAV: Roger. So uh... thanks for coming back to get me. 
19:27:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:27,81, [19:27]JOHANSSEN: It's the least we could do. How is the MAV retrofit going? 
19:28:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:28,81," [19:28]MAV: So far, so good. NASA put a lot of thought into the procedures. They work. That's not to say they're easy. I spent the last 3 days removing Hull Panel 19 and the front window. Even in Mars-G they're heavy motherfuckers. "
19:29:00,The Martian,Andy Weir,19:29,81," [19:29]JOHANSSEN: When we pick you up, I will make wild, passionate love to you. Prepare your body. "

Target of Opportunity      The Biosyn Corporation of Cupertino, California, had never called an emergency meeting of its board of directors. The ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and impatient. It was 8:00 p.m. They had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes, but slowly had fallen silent. Shuffling papers. Looking pointedly at their watches. ""What are we waiting for""?"
20:12:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,8:12 P.M.,11,"And then nothing changed. He and Kim remained cordial but distant, no matter how much I tried to sell them on each other. The funny thing was, I never really bought into Kim’s notion that they were somehow bound together through me—until just now when I saw her half carrying him down the hospital corridor. 8:12 P.M.  I watch Kim and Adam disappear down the hall. I mean to follow them but I’m glued to the linoleum, unable to move my phantom legs. It’s only after they disappear around a corner that I rouse myself and trail after them, but they’ve already gone inside the elevator. By now I’ve figured out that I don’t have any supernatural abilities."

Our job is to kill the enemy. 8:30 P.M.: Personal time. Free of Reznik at last. We wash our jumpsuits, shine our boots, scrub the barracks floor and the latrine, clean our rifles, pass around dirty magazines, and swap other contraband like candy and chewing gum. We play cards and bust each other’s nuts and complain about Reznik."
21:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,9:00 p.m.,17,"""But I'm tired,"" she said. ""Okay, Lex,"" Grant said, picking her up. ""Oof, you're heavy"". It was almost 9:00 p.m. The full moon was blurred by drifting mist, and their blunted shadows led them across an open field, toward dark woods beyond. Grant was lost in thought, trying to decide where he was. Since they had originally crossed over the fence that the tyrannosaur had battered down, Grant was reasonably sure they were now somewhere in the tyrannosaur paddock. Which was a place he did not want to be."

And though it would take me four more years, eventually I’d nab the solo. 9:06 P.M.  “I’ve got exactly twenty minutes before our manager has a total shit fit”. Brooke Vega’s raspy voice booms in the hospital’s now-quiet lobby. So this is Adam’s idea: Brooke Vega, the indie-music goddess and lead singer of Bikini. In a trademark punky glam outfit—tonight it’s a short bubble skirt, fishnets, high black leather boots, an artfully ripped-up Shooting Star T-shirt, topped off with a vintage fur shrug and a pair of black Jackie O glasses—she stands out in the hospital lobby like an ostrich in a chicken coop."

Are the Teds the final wave, or is there another one coming, a fifth wave that will make the first four pale in comparison? Thinking about a fifth wave shuts down the conversation. 9:30 P.M.: Lights-out. Time to lie awake and think of a wholly new and creative way to waste Sergeant Reznik. After a while I get tired of that and think about the girls I’ve dated, shuffling them around in various orders. Hottest."

22:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,10:00 p.m.,11,"As a result, the staff could not accurately measure how much the animals were eating. The security system, which controlled all the security-card-operated doors, cut out whenever main power was lost, and did not come back on with auxiliary power. The security Program only ran with main power. The physical conservation program, intended to dim lights after 10:00 p.m., only worked on alternate days of the week. The automated fecal analysis (called Auto Poop), designed to check for parasites in the animal stools, invariably recorded all specimens as having the parasite Phagostomum venulosum, although none did. The program then automatically dispensed medication into the animals' food. If the handlers dumped the medicine out of the hoppers to prevent its being dispensed, an alarm sounded which could not be turned off."

I know that all the magic kisses in the world probably couldn’t have helped him today. But I would do anything to have been able to give him one. 10:40 P.M.  I run away. I leave Adam, Kim, and Willow in the lobby and I just start careening through the hospital. I don’t realize I’m looking for the pediatric ward until I get there. I tear through the halls, past rooms with nervous four-year-olds sleeping restlessly before tomorrow’s tonsillectomies, past the neonatal ICU with babies the size of fists, hooked up to more tubes than I am, past the pediatric oncology unit where bald cancer patients sleep under cheerful murals of rainbows and balloons."
