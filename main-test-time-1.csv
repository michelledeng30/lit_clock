00:00:00,Siege and Storm,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,41,"Tolya and Tamar were there, alert as always, scanning the crowd. Mal was nowhere to be seen. I’d stayed up the previous night in the common room, hoping to catch him and ask him personally to attend. It was long past midnight when I gave up and went to bed. The two huge dishes were positioned on opposite sides of the roof, on the flat lip that extended between the domes of the eastern and western wings. They could be rotated through a system of pulleys, and each was manned by a Materialnik and a Squaller, outfitted in goggles to protect against the glare. I saw that Zoya and Paja had been teamed together, and Nadia had been paired with a Durast on the second dish."
00:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,midnight,19,"Gennaro stormed in. ""We still don't have any telephones"". ""Working on it"". ""You've been working on it since midnight. And Malcolm is worse. He needs medical attention"". ""It means I'll have to shut down,"" Arnold said."
00:00:00,Heir of Fire,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,69,"More and more, until there was not a road they had not covered, until there was not one soul who did not know that Aelin Galathynius was alive—­and willing to stand against Adarlan. Across the White Fangs and the Ruhnns, all the way to the Western Wastes and the red-haired queen who ruled from a crumbling castle. To the Deserted Peninsula and the oasis-­fortress of the Silent Assassins. Hooves, hooves, hooves, echoing through the continent, sparking against cobblestones, all the way to Banjali and the riverfront palace of the King and Queen of Eyllwe, still in their midnight mourning clothes. Hold on, the riders told the world. Hold on. •  Dorian’s father was in a rage the likes of which he’d not seen before."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,4," “I rather like that scar, too,” she said with a midnight smile. That explained why he’d left the tunic unbuttoned, then."
00:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,midnight,6,"I want it all Sunday morning, in San Jose airport, in cash"". ""It'll be waiting for you,"" Dodgson said. ""Don't worry"". Malcolm      Shortly before midnight, be stepped on the plane at the Dallas airport, a tall, thin, balding man of thirty-five, dressed entirely in black: black shirt, black trousers, black socks, black sneakers. ""Ah, Dr. Malcolm,"" Hammond said, smiling with forced graciousness. Malcolm grinned. ""Hello, John."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,8,"“Faliq,” Chaol growled, and the woman slid her midnight eyes toward him. If Nesryn’s family name didn’t give away her heritage, it was those eyes, slightly uptilted at the corners and lightly lined with kohl, that revealed at least one of her parents was from the Southern Continent. Interesting that the woman didn’t try to hide it, that she chose to wear the kohl even while on a mission, despite Rifthold’s less-than-pleasant policies toward immigrants. Chaol jerked his chin toward their vanishing companions."
00:00:00,Jurassic Park,Michael Crichton,midnight,3,"On the contrary, he felt his original views were correct: that a lizard species had been driven from the forest into a new habitat, and was coming into contact with village people. Guitierrez was certain that in a few more weeks the lizards would settle down and the biting episodes won end. The tropical rain fell in great drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic in Bah��a Anasco. It was nearly midnight; power had been lost in the storm, and the midwife Elena Morales was working by flashlight when she heard a squeaking, chirping sound. Thinking that it was a rat, she quickly put a compress on the forehead of the mother and went into the next room to check on the newborn baby. As her hand touched the doorknob, she heard the chirping again, and she relaxed. Evidently it was just a bird, flying in the window to get out of the rain."
00:00:00,Heir of Fire,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,68,"“Your mother would be proud,” Emrys said. Celaena put a hand on her heart and bowed in thanks. Rowan cleared his throat, and Celaena gave them one last parting smile before she followed the prince into the trees—­to Doranelle, and to Maeve, at last. 58  “Just be ready to leave for Suria in two days,” Aedion ordered Ren as the three of them gathered at midnight in the apartment where Ren and Murtaugh had stayed, still unaware of who it belonged to. “Take the southern gate—­it’ll be the least monitored at that hour”. It had been weeks since they’d last met, and three days since a vague letter had arrived for Murtaugh from Sol of Suria, a friendly invitation to a long-­lost friend to visit him. The wording was simple enough that they all knew the young lord was feeling them out, hinting at interest in the “opportunity” Murtagh had mentioned in an earlier letter."
00:00:00,The Maze Runner,James Dashner,midnight,33,"
They had another meal, searched some more. They found nothing, and Thomas was beginning to get ready to accept the inevitable—that there was nothing to find. When wall-closing time rolled around, he started looking for signs of Grievers, was struck by an icy hesitation at every corner. He and Minho always had knives clasped firmly in both hands. But nothing showed up until almost midnight."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,38," “For distraction.” There was a suspicious gleam in those midnight eyes of hers—enough so that he said, “Not for that.”"
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,41," She moved like a midnight storm. Whatever training she’d had in Wendlyn, whatever that prince had taught her … Gods help them all."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,46, “And I suppose you blame me?” Aelin said with midnight softness.
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,56," Like a doll, like a ghost, Kaltain turned, that midnight gown swirling with her, and stalked toward the heavy red curtains, slipping through them as if she were no more than mist."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,62," Her midnight eyes were bright, and even with her face splattered in black blood, her smile—relieved, a bit wild with the thrill of the fight, their victory—was … beautiful."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,67," It had been a joke, really. Aelin had picked the smallest patrol led by the mildest of the commanders. She and Rowan had ambushed the patrol just before midnight in a quiet part of the city. She’d barely killed two guards before the rest were dead at Rowan’s hand—and when the commander tried to run, the Fae warrior had caught him within heartbeats."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,22," The girl ducked her head, her sheet of midnight hair sliding over her pale face—but not before Manon caught the flash of assessment in her dark eyes."
00:00:00,Heir of Fire,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,33,"Sorrel was grounded enough to even them both out. The perfect Third. “The only ones having fun right now,” Asterin said, “are the green-­eyed demon-­twins”. Indeed, the midnight-­haired Faline and Fallon ­were grinning with maniacal glee as they led three covens in knife-­throwing exercises, using their inferiors as target practice. Manon just shook her head. What­ever worked; ­whatever shook the dust off these Blackbeak ­warriors. “And my Shadows?"
00:00:00,Heir of Fire,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,10,"And her grandmother . . . The rich, voluminous midnight robes of Mother Blackbeak flowed like water in the crisp breeze. Her grandmother’s face was now marred with the beginnings of wrinkles, her ebony hair sprinkled with silver. The High Witch of the Blackbeak Clan ­wasn’t just beautiful—­she was alluring. Even now, with mortal years pressing down upon her bone-­white skin, there was something entrancing about the Matron."
00:00:00,Crown of Midnight,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,34,"And he’d known, too, just whom he was murdering and dismembering—and what it would mean to her. A familiar, dark fire rippled in her gut, spreading through her, dragging her down into an abyss without end. Celaena Sardothien stood from her chair. Chapter 35  There would be no candles for these midnight deeds, no ivory horn to signal the start of this hunt. She dressed in her darkest tunic and slid a smooth black mask into her cloak pocket. All of her weapons, even the hairpins, had been removed from her rooms. She knew without checking that the doors and windows were being watched."
00:00:00,Insurgent,Veronica Roth,midnight,27,"I shake my hands as I pace. They’re still trembling. I want to know what time it is. I arrived a little after midnight. It must be early in the morning by now, maybe 4:00, or 5:00. Or maybe it hasn’t been that long, and only seems that way because I haven’t been doing anything. The door opens, and at last I stand face-to-face with my enemy and her Dauntless guards."
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,37,"Without a thought, she tossed the water onto the marks, then raced to her bathing chamber to draw more water. When the water had finished loosening the chalk, she took a towel and scrubbed the floor until her back ached and her legs and hands were frozen. Then, only then, did she throw on a pair of pants and a tunic and head out the door. Thankfully, the guards didn’t say anything when she asked them to escort her to the library at midnight. They remained in the main room of the library as she set off through the stacks, heading toward the musty, forgotten alcove where she’d found the majority of the books on the Wyrdmarks. She couldn’t walk fast enough, and kept looking over her shoulder. Was she next?"
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,39,"Several people stared at her. They wore gowns and jackets so elaborate that she wondered if the ball had been moved to lunchtime. The High Priestess walked onto the stone platform and raised her hands above her head. The folds of her midnight-blue gossamer robe fell around her, and her white hair was long and unbound. An eight-pointed star was tattooed upon her brow in a shade of blue that matched her gown, its sharp lines extending to her hairline. “Welcome all, and may the blessings of the Goddess and all her gods be upon you”. Her voice echoed across the chamber to reach even those in the back."
00:00:00,Insurgent,Veronica Roth,midnight,7,"says Susan from somewhere in the darkness behind me. We stop. Susan collapses to the ground, crying, and Caleb crouches next to her. Tobias and I look toward the city, which is still illuminated, because it’s not midnight yet. I want to feel something. Fear, anger, grief. But I don’t."
00:00:00,Crown of Midnight,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,6,"“If she picked Roland over you, that makes her the greatest fool who ever lived”. He stared at her for a long moment before he quietly said, “Thank you,” and walked back to his room. Celaena watched him go, watched those powerful muscles shifting in his back, visible even through his dark tunic, suddenly grateful that this Lithaen had long ago left the castle. The midnight hour chimed through the castle, the off-kilter ringing of the wretched clock tower in the garden echoing through the dark, silent halls. Though Chaol had escorted her to her door, five minutes of pacing in her bedroom had sent her wandering again, heading for the library. She had mountains of unread books sitting in her rooms but didn’t feel like reading any of them. She needed something to do."
00:00:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth,midnight,32,"I nod and open my eyes. We both stand, and he tugs me with him to the open door of the train car. The wind is not as strong now that the train has slowed. It’s past midnight, so all the street lights are dark, and the buildings look like mammoths as they rise from the darkness and then sink into it again. Tobias lifts a hand and points at a cluster of buildings, so far away they are the size of a fingernail. They are the only bright spot in the dark sea around us. Erudite headquarters again."
00:00:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth,midnight,28,"I don’t intend to talk to Four—at least, not until I find out where he’s going, late at night, in the glass building above us. I run quietly, breathless when I reach the stairs, and stand at one end of the glass room while Four stands at the other. Through the windows I see the city lights, glowing now but petering out even as I look at them. They are supposed to turn off at midnight. Across the room, Four stands at the door to the fear landscape. He holds a black box in one hand and a syringe in the other. “Since you’re here,” he says, without looking over his shoulder, “you might as well go in with me”."
00:00:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth,midnight,12,"Behind us, most of the buildings were in use, and even if they weren’t, they looked well-tended. In front of us is a sea of crumbling concrete and broken glass. The silence of this part of the city is eerie; it feels like a nightmare. It’s hard to see where I’m going, because it’s after midnight and all the city lights are off. Marlene takes out a flashlight and shines it at the street in front of us. “Scared of the dark, Mar? ” the dark-eyed Dauntless-born initiate teases."
00:00:00,The Giver,Lois Lowry,midnight,20,"They knew it would be a very difficult journey. Then, in the middle of the night before the Ceremony, Jonas would secretly leave his dwelling. This was probably the most dangerous part, because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on official business to leave a dwelling at night. ""I'll leave at midnight,"" Jonas said. ""The Food Collectors will be finished picking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the Path-Maintenance Crews don't start their work that early. So there won't be anyone to see me, unless of course someone is out on emergency business"". ""I don't know what you should do if you are seen, Jonas,"" The Giver had said."
00:00:00,The Lost World,Michael Crichton,midnight,10,Land at one. Back on the boat by five. Back at the port by seven. Back in San Francisco by midnight. Bang. Done. Finito.
00:00:00,Crown of Midnight,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,23,"She was still laughing when the world went black and her fingers hit the rocky ground—barely an inch away from the wall. Chaol stood from his seat at her foyer table as the door quietly opened. The outside hall was dark, the lights burned out; most of the castle asleep and tucked into their beds. He’d heard the clock chime midnight some time ago, but he knew it wasn’t exhaustion weighing down Celaena’s shoulders when she slipped into her rooms. Her eyes were purple beneath, her face wan, lips colorless. Fleetfoot rushed to him, tail wagging, and licked him a few times on the hand before she trotted into the bedroom, leaving them alone. Celaena glanced once at him, her turquoise-and-gold eyes weary and haunted, and began unfastening her cloak as she walked past him into the bedroom."
00:00:00,Crown of Midnight,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,27,"It had been a few days since Celaena had tracked her targets. Cloaked in darkness, she stood in the shadows of the docks, not quite believing what she was seeing. All the men on her list, all the ones she’d been following, the ones who might know what the king was up to—were leaving. She’d seen one of them sneak into an unmarked carriage and had followed him here, where he’d boarded a ship set to depart at the midnight tide. And then, to her dismay, the other three had shown up, too, their families in tow, before they were quickly ushered belowdecks. All those men, all that information she’d been gathering, just—  “I’m sorry,” a familiar voice said behind her, and she whirled to find Archer approaching. How was he so stealthy?"
00:00:00,The Lost World,Michael Crichton,midnight,6,"Arby and Kelly exchanged glances. This was news to them, too. Thorne said, ""I'll need you to drive one of these, Eddie. We've got to be at the airport by midnight"". ""But I thought we were field testing. ""No time for that. We're going right to the location""."
00:00:00,Allegiant,Veronica Roth,midnight,12,"That night we push our cots just a little closer together, and look into each other’s eyes in the moments before we fall asleep. When he finally drifts off, our fingers are twisted together in the space between the beds. I smile a little, and let myself go too. CHAPTER SIXTEEN TOBIAS THE SUN STILL hasn’t completely set when we fall asleep, but I wake a few hours later, at midnight, my mind too busy for rest, swarming with thoughts and questions and doubts. Tris released me earlier, and her fingers now brush the floor. She is sprawled over the mattress, her hair covering her eyes. I shove my feet into my shoes and walk the hallways, shoelaces slapping the carpets."
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,Midnight,27, Midnight chimed in the great clock of the library’s main atrium.
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,32," It had been a matter of a few minutes. Sartaq had ordered her to switch from her midnight-blue jacket to the spare leather one folded in a chest of drawers shoved against the far wall. He’d politely turned his back when she changed pants as well. Since her hair fell only to her shoulders, she had difficulty braiding it back, but the prince had fished into his own pockets and supplied her with a leather thong to pull it back into a knot."
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,37," She awoke past midnight with her fork on her chest and spiced, slow-cooked chicken staining her favorite blue gown."
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,56," Slowly, she looked back over her shoulder, her dark hair shifting like midnight silk."
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,73," Up close, the eyes she’d mistaken for dark were a midnight sapphire. He’d likely been moderately handsome in his youth. “News of what?”"
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,117, And midnight kahve.
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,26, A summer storm galloped in off the Narrow Sea just before midnight.
00:00:00,Kingdom of Ash,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,77," Aelin didn’t care. Only that they sailed with the midnight tide, Rowan’s magic propelling them swiftly out to the moonlit sea."
00:00:00,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,midnight,41,"""You did not wake me,"" Maester Aemon replied. ""I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome persion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour""? ""To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night's Watch"". ""This is no concern of Maester Aemon,"" Chett complained."
00:00:00,The Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan,midnight,1,"She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown. From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She would point her crooked finger at me and say, ""Now, honey,"" real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school detention for a month. One time, after she'd made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I told Grover I didn't think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, ""You're absolutely right"". Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned around and said, ""Will you shut up""?"
00:00:00,The Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan,midnight,32,"It took off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the edge of the ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm. It was like standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to see much, but knowing the void was right there. The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I should've been crushed by the pressure. Then again, I shouldn't have been able to breathe."
00:00:00,The Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan,midnight,34,"Underneath, stenciled on the glass doors: NO SOLICITORS. NO LOITERING. NO LIVING. It was almost midnight, but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people. Behind the security desk sat a tough-looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece. I turned to my friends. ""Okay."
00:00:00,The Sea of Monsters,Rick Riordan,midnight,13,"Standing right next to me was a guy in nylon running shorts and a New York City Marathon T-shirt. He was slim and fit, with salt-and-pepper hair and a sly smile. He looked kind of familiar, but I couldn’t figure out why. My first thought was that he must’ve been taking a midnight jog down the beach and strayed inside the camp borders. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Regular mortals couldn’t enter the valley. But maybe with the tree’s magic weakening he’d managed to slip in."
00:00:00,The Sea of Monsters,Rick Riordan,midnight,24,"I didn’t really want to know. Once I saw Nereids, the glowing lady spirits of the sea. I tried to wave at them, but they disappeared into the depths, leaving me unsure whether they’d seen me or not. Sometime after midnight, Annabeth came up on deck. We were just passing a smoking volcano island. The sea bubbled and steamed around the shore. “One of the forges of Hephaestus,” Annabeth said."
00:00:00,Kingdom of Ash,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,137," A clock chimed midnight, off-kilter and odious, and Dorian strode back down the hall, finding another route to Maeve’s chambers. A quick shift in a shadowed alcove had him scuttling along the floor again, his mouse’s eyes seeing well enough in the dark."
00:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,12," She’d barely looked at him these past ten minutes they’d been waiting for the healer to arrive. Her face was haggard, her shoulder-length hair limp. She hadn’t put on her captain’s uniform, but rather returned to her usual midnight-blue tunic and black pants. As if she couldn’t stand to be in Adarlan’s colors."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,122," Aelin and Manon were shown another scene. Of a whispered conversation at midnight, deep beneath the glass castle."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,82," Lorcan’s eyes at last found her own, and his voice was a midnight growl as he said, “As far as anyone’s concerned, you’re still my wife.”"
00:00:00,P.S. I Still Love You,Jenny Han,midnight,58,"I squirm. I’d hoped she wouldn’t bring it up. The last thing I want to do is discuss her midnight rendezvous with Mr. Morales! We watched Stormy go back to her apartment and then waited half an hour before John went back to Mr. Morales’s. Weakly, I say, “Sorry we snuck out. It was so early, and we couldn’t fall asleep, so we thought we’d play in the snow.”"
00:00:00,P.S. I Still Love You,Jenny Han,midnight,56,"Stormy serves us piña coladas that she mixes in her blender with “just a splash of rum to warm us up,” and she microwaves frozen spanakopita that neither of us touches. Bing Crosby is playing on her stereo. By nine thirty Stormy is yawning and saying she’ll need her beauty sleep soon. John and I exchange a look—it’s still so early, and I don’t know the last time I went to bed before midnight."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,76," The downpour had softened to a steady drizzle by the time the clock struck one, yet Aelin hadn’t come down from the roof. She’d gone up there to take over Aedion’s watch, apparently—and Rowan had waited, biding his time as the clock neared midnight and then passed it. Chaol had come by to give Aedion a report on the movements of Arobynn’s men, but slipped back out around twelve."
00:00:00,P.S. I Still Love You,Jenny Han,midnight,18,"After midnight, I’ve set the cookies on the cooling rack and put on my cat pajamas, and I’m climbing into bed to read when there’s a knock at my window. I think it’s Chris, and I go to the window to check and see if I’ve locked it, but it’s not—it’s Peter! I push the window up. “Oh my God, Peter! What are you doing here?” I whisper, my heart pounding. “My dad’s home!”"
00:00:00,To All the Boys I've Loved Before,Jenny Han,midnight,70,"Close to midnight, I gather up Kitty and the puppy and the sparklers. We put on heavy coats and I make Kitty wear a hat. “Should we put a hat on Jamie too?” she asks me."
00:00:00,To All the Boys I've Loved Before,Jenny Han,midnight,69,"IT’S NEW YEAR’S EVE. NEW year’s eve has always been a stay-at-home holiday for us. We make popcorn and drink sparkling cider, and at midnight we go outside to the backyard and light up sparklers."
00:00:00,To All the Boys I've Loved Before,Jenny Han,midnight,9,"“It’s almost midnight. We’re five hours ahead, remember?”"
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,80," Aelin peered down at her former master, her face blank save for a slight tightening around her mouth. “I hope the dark god finds a special place for you in his realm,” she said, and a shiver went down Rowan’s spine at the midnight caress in her tone."
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,94," “I think not, Prince,” she said in her midnight voice. She sniffed again, her nose crinkling slightly. “But would you bleed red, or black?”"
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,104, “We don’t need—” Lysandra’s eyes fell upon the wax seal. A snake in midnight ink: Clarisse’s sigil. “What is this?”
00:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,104," His old commander was waiting, arms crossed over his broad chest. He surveyed Rowan with a frown, noting the bandages and his bare torso. “Should I thank you for putting on pants?” Lorcan said, his voice barely more than a midnight wind."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,23," Unlike Petrah’s. Caution—warning shone in her deep blue eyes. She wore her riding leathers, a cloak of midnight blue hanging from bronze clasps at her shoulders, her golden braid snaking over her chest. Petrah had always been odd, head in the clouds, but that was the way of the Bluebloods. Mystics, fanatics, zealots were among the pleasanter terms used to describe them and their worship of the Three-Faced Goddess."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,55," As for the rest of it … It was just past midnight when Aelin wondered how the hell she and Rowan would ever go back to normalcy if they survived this war. If there’d be a day when it wasn’t easy to leap over rooftops as if they were stones on a stream, to break into someone’s room and hold a blade to the occupant’s throat."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,56," Aedion had been up half the night, debating the merits of every possible place to meet his father. On the beach seemed like it was asking for a private conversation he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to have; in Rolfe’s headquarters felt too public; the inn courtyard felt too formal … He’d tossed and turned on his cot, nearly asleep when he heard Aelin and Rowan returning well past midnight. Not surprising they’d snuck out without telling anyone. But at least she’d gone with the Fae Prince."
00:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,79," Her spoon stilled in the chipped wooden bowl. Slowly, she turned her face toward him. Unreadable, a face crafted of nightmares and midnight fantasies."
00:00:00,Allegiant,Veronica Roth,midnight,23,"“Don’t for a second think I’m interested in anyone but you”. He puts his hand on the back of my neck and draws my mouth toward his. The kiss and his words both comfort me, but my unease doesn’t completely disappear. CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE TOBIAS TRIS AND I meet Nita in the hotel lobby after midnight, among the potted plants with their unfurling flowers, a tame wilderness. When Nita sees Tris at my side, her face tightens like she just tasted something bitter. “You promised you wouldn’t tell her,” she says, pointing at me. “What happened to protecting her?"
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,36,"“When you’re my father’s Champion, you can attend all the balls you want”. She made a face. He wanted to tell her then that if he could, he would have asked her to go with him; that he wanted to spend time with her, that he thought of her even when they were apart; but he knew she would have laughed. The clock chimed midnight. “I should probably go,” he said, stretching his arms. “I have a day of council meetings to look forward to tomorrow, and I don’t think Duke Perrington will be pleased if I’m half-asleep for all of them”. Celaena smirked."
00:00:00,The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins,midnight,9,"It's a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear younger and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival."
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,midnight,15,"It would be impossible to miss the arrival of a train, or even a single person. But hours pass and no one comes. With each minute, it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survived the assault on the Nut. It's well after midnight when Cressida comes to attach a special microphone to my costume. ""What's this for""? I ask. Haymitch's voice comes on to explain."
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,midnight,12,"""No"". A long time passes before he adds, ""She crept up on me"". I search my heart, but at the moment the only person I can feel creeping up on me is Snow. It must be midnight, it must be tomorrow when Haymitch pushes open the door. ""They're back. We're wanted in the hospital"". My mouth opens with a flood of questions that he cuts off with ""That's all I know""."
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,midnight,16,"The gunshot was only a temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the wordsHe says he'd like to see you. But now that I have, there's no way to refuse. At midnight, I'm standing outside the door to his cell. Hospital room. We had to wait for Plutarch to finish getting his wedding footage, which, despite the lack of what he calls razzle-dazzle, he's pleased with. ""The best thing about the Capitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is that you people still have a little spontaneity."
00:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey,midnight,46,"He’s passed out. 69 AT DAWN he’s still out cold, so I grab my rifle and hike out of the woods to assess his handiwork. Probably not the smartest thing to do. What if our midnight raiders called for backup? I’d be the prize in a turkey shoot. I’m not a bad shot, but I’m no Evan Walker. Well, even Evan Walker is no Evan Walker."
00:00:00,A Court of Thorns and Roses,Sarah J. Maas,Midnight,52," I suppressed a shudder. “Midnight snack,” I said, and I was keenly aware of every movement, every breath I took as I neared him. "
00:00:00,A Court of Thorns and Roses,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,70," Two in the morning, and yet the party was showing no signs of slowing. My father held court with several other merchants and aristo men to whom I had been introduced but whose names I’d instantly forgotten. Elain was laughing among a circle of beautiful friends, flushed and brilliant. Nesta had silently left at midnight, and I didn’t bother to say good-bye as I finally slipped upstairs. "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,3," The tattoo on her brow was of midnight-blue ink—but somehow still fit, still accented the feminine dresses, the bright silver jewelry. Unlike the elegant brutality of mine. "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,14," Great, beautiful, brutal wings, membranous and clawed like a bat’s, dark as night and strong as hell. Even the way he stood seemed altered—steadier, grounded. Like some final piece of him had clicked into place. But Rhysand’s voice was still midnight-soft and he said, “What did Azriel have to say about it?” "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,18," It was after midnight when I gave up waiting, walked down the dark, silent corridors, and found him in his study, alone for once. "
00:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,midnight,26,"Don't even think about going back on the beach, though, until I can assess the damage"". I take Peeta's face in my hands. ""Don't worry. I'll see you at midnight"". I give him a kiss and, before he can object any further, I let go and turn to Johanna. ""Ready""? ""Why not""?"
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,Midnight,19,"""Well, that sort of comment isn't recommending you either,"" says Jackson. ""Put her in the rotation,"" I hear Boggs say behind me. Jackson shakes her head and makes a note. ""Midnight to four. You're on with me"". The dinner whistle sounds, and Gale and I line up at the canteen. ""Do you want me to kill him""?"
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,midnight,19,"I don't know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can't even conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded arena, locating Snow, and putting a bullet through his head look like child's play. At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn't sleeping, though. Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest, clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope."
00:00:00,Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins,midnight,21,"For some reason, the last stanza to ""The Hanging Tree"" starts running through my head. The one where the man wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evil that awaits her in the world. Are you, are you  Coming to the tree  Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me. Strange things did happen here  No stranger would it be  If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree. ""I'll kill you before that happens,"" says Gale. ""I promise"". Peeta hesitates, as if considering the reliability of this offer, and then shakes his head."
00:00:00,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,midnight,30,"The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from Littlefinger's windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die. He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger's blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep."
00:00:00,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,midnight,11,"The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. ""What are they""? she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder. ""Dragon's eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,"" said Magister Illyrio."
00:00:00,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,midnight,3,"
Drogo's braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs."
00:00:00,A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,midnight,3,"Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King's Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper's dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes."
00:00:00,An Abundance of Katherines,John Green,midnight,11,"He barely registered the change when they turned off the TV and started playing pool. He just kept scribbling. He loved the scratching of pencil against paper when he was this focused: it meant something was happening. When the clock read midnight, Colin put his pencil down. He looked up at Lindsey, who was standing on one foot, bent over the pool table at an absurdly awkward angle. Hassan seemed to have left the room. “Hey,” said Colin."
00:00:00,An Abundance of Katherines,John Green,midnight,16,"“Um,” he said. Distracted from the road, Colin watched as she gave him the slightest version of her inimitable smile. thirteen That Sunday, Hassan went “cruising” with Lindsey and Katrina and TOC and JATT and SOCT. The next night, he went cruising again, and came home after midnight to find Colin working on his Theorem, which now worked seventeen of nineteen times. He still couldn’t get it to work for either Katherine III or, more importantly, Katherine XIX. “’Sup? ” asked Hassan."
00:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green,midnight,21,"In Alabama, you can get married at eighteen (fourteen with Mom and Dad’s permission), but you have to be nineteen to smoke. “So fine me. I just need to know what you saw”. “Ah most always work from six t’ midnight, but I was coverin’ the graveyard shift. We got a call ’bout a jackknifed truck, and I’s only about a mile away, so I headed over, and I’d just pulled up. I’s still in mah cruiser, and I seen out the corner a’ my eye the headlights, and my lights was on and I turned the siren on, but the lights just kept comin’ straight at me, son, and I got out quick and run off and she just barreled inta me. I seen plenty, but I ain’t never seen that."
00:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green,midnight,3,"I had always liked that: I liked routine. I liked being bored. I didn’t want to, but I did. And so May fifth could have been any day—until just before midnight, when Margo Roth Spiegelman slid open my screenless bedroom window for the first time since telling me to close it nine years before. 2. I swiveled around when I heard the window open, and Margo’s blue eyes were staring back at me. Her eyes were all I could see at first, but as my vision adjusted, I realized she was wearing black face paint and a black hoodie."
00:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green,midnight,11,"” I walked into the dining room and leaned against the wall, standing opposite the stranger. I’d thought of my answer to this question already. “Yeah,” I said. “She showed up at my window at like midnight and we talked for a minute and then Mr. Spiegelman caught her and she went back to her house”. “And was that—? Did you see her after that? ” Mr. Spiegelman asked."
00:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green,midnight,14,"“I’m about to go shoe shopping with Lacey”. “Shoe shopping? ” “Yeah. Everything’s thirty percent off from ten to midnight. She wants me to help her pick out her prom shoes. I mean, she had some, but I was over at her house yesterday and we agreed that they weren’t . ."
00:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green,midnight,17,"” “Mom, do you really need pictures of me going to prom stag? I mean, hasn’t my life been humiliating enough? ” She laughed. “Call before curfew,” my dad said, which was midnight. “Sure thing,” I said. It was so easy to lie to them that I found myself wondering why I’d never much done it before that night with Margo. I took I-4 west toward Kissimmee and the theme parks, and then passed I-Drive where Margo and I had broken into SeaWorld, and then took Highway 27 down toward Haines City."
00:00:00,Forrest Gump,Winston Groom,midnight,8,"Trouble was, I could not never get the speech learnt. Oh, I could see all the words in my head okay, but when it come time to say it, everthin get all muddled up. Colonel Gooch is beside hissef. He make me stay up till almost midnight ever day, tryin to get the speech right, but finally he thowed up his hans an say, ""I can see this is not gonna work"". Then he come up with a idea. ""Gump,"" he say, ""here's what we is gonna do. I am gonna cut this speech shorter, an so all you will have to do is say a few things."
00:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green,midnight,23,"I couldn’t help but think about school and everything else ending. I liked standing just outside the couches and watching them—it was a kind of sad I didn’t mind, and so I just listened, letting all the happiness and the sadness of this ending swirl around in me, each sharpening the other. For the longest time, it felt kind of like my chest was cracking open, but not precisely in an unpleasant way. I left just before midnight. Some people were staying later, but it was my curfew, and plus I didn’t feel like staying. Mom was half asleep on the couch, but she perked up when she saw me. “Did you have fun?"
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,24," That midnight voice said with quiet cold that licked down my spine, “As do I.” "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,27,"I frowned at the midnight-blue dress I’d selected—even with the long sleeves and heavy, luxurious fabric, the plunging vee of the neckline did nothing against the cold. I’d debated wearing the sweater and thicker pants, but had opted for finery over comfort. I already regretted it, even with the coat. But if his Inner Circle was anything like Tamlin’s court … better to wear the more formal attire."
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,39," A mere minute after I’d risen to consciousness, Rhys knocked on my door. I’d barely granted him permission to enter before he stalked inside like a midnight wind, and chucked a belt hung with knives onto the foot of the bed. "
00:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,13, Especially when seven naga broke into the estate grounds just past midnight. 
00:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,28, Rhys paused in the center of a midnight-blue handwoven rug and gestured to the sealed doors on his left. “Bedroom.” He waved a lazy hand toward the single door on the opposite wall. “Bathing room.” 
00:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,64," A rumble of midnight thunder brushed against the walls of my mind. A silent signal, speared over land and mountains. As if Rhys’s concentration was now wholly focused elsewhere—and he did not dare break it. "
00:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,midnight,14,"I'd say the odds are against it,"" says Peeta. The chariot rides - in which the District 12 kids are dressed in awful coal miners' outfits - and the interviews flash by. There's little time to focus on anyone. But since Haymitch is going to be the victor, we get to see one full exchange between him and Caesar Flickerman, who looks exactly as he always does in his twinkling midnight blue suit. Only his dark green hair, eyelids, and lips are different. ""So, Haymitch, what do you think of the Games having one hundred percent more competitors than usual""? asks Caesar."
00:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,71," Though we would be going to the meeting as we truly were, our usual attire remained the same: Rhys in his preferred black jacket and pants, Azriel and Cassian in their Illyrian armor, all seven Siphons polished and gleaming. Mor had forgone her usual red gown for one of midnight blue. It was cut with the same revealing panels and flowing, gauzy skirts, but there was something … restrained in it. Regal. A princess of the realm. "
00:00:00,A ​Court of Silver Flames,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,61," It was midnight when she took a break from reading The Dance of Battle and rubbed her temples. She hadn’t put it down, not even to eat dinner at her desk, holding it with one hand while she devoured her stew with the other."
00:00:00,A ​Court of Silver Flames,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,130," Feyre commanded the crowd, her voice like thunder at midnight, “Dance.”"
00:00:00,A ​Court of Silver Flames,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,144," Rhys came up beside him, his face white with that same dread. “Devlon just confirmed everything. The Blood Rite began at midnight.”"
00:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,midnight,5,"""He wanted it to be real"". I go back to my room and lie under the covers, trying not to think of Gale and thinking of nothing else. That night, on the stage before the Training Center, we bubble our way through a list of questions. Caesar Flickerman, in his twinkling midnight blue suit, his hair, eyelids, and lips still dyed powder blue, flawlessly guides us through the interview. When he asks us about the future, Peeta gets down on one knee, pours out his heart, and begs me to marry him. I, of course, accept. Caesar is beside himself, the Capitol audience is hysterical, shots of crowds around Panem show a country besotted with happiness."
00:00:00,A ​Court of Silver Flames,Sarah J. Maas,Midnight,145, “I can’t go.” Midnight storms swirled in Rhys’s eyes.
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,24,"She didn’t fear the night, though she found little comfort in its dark hours. It was just the time when she slept, the time when she stalked and killed, the time when the stars emerged with glittering beauty and made her feel wonderfully small and insignificant. Celaena frowned. It was only midnight, and even though they had another Test tomorrow, she couldn’t sleep. Her eyes were too heavy to read, she wouldn’t play the pianoforte for fear of another embarrassing encounter, and she most certainly wouldn’t amuse herself with fantasies of what the feast was like. She was still wearing her emerald-blue gown, too lazy to change. She traced the moonlight to where it lapped upon the tapestry-covered wall."
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,29,"She missed. Gritting her teeth, she considered snapping the cue in half across her knee. But she’d been attempting to play for only an hour. She’d be incredible by midnight! She’d master this ridiculous game or she’d turn the table into firewood. And use it to burn Cain alive. Celaena jabbed the cue, and hit the ball with such force that it zoomed toward the back wall of the table, knocking three colored balls out of its way before it collided with the number three ball, sending it shooting straight for a hole."
00:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,32,"She opened her mouth, then shook her head. “What are you doing here? It’s almost midnight, and I’ve got a Test tomorrow”. She couldn’t deny having him here was a bit of a relief—the murderer only seemed to attack Champions when they were alone. “Have you moved from literature to history? ” He surveyed the books on the table."
00:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,8," I crawled back to the manor two hours after midnight, too exhausted to last until dawn. "
00:00:00,The Titan's Curse,Rick Riordan,midnight,9,"The ceiling of darkness began to crumble again, pushing Annabeth against the ground. I sat bolt upright in bed, clawing at the sheets. There was no sound in my cabin except the gurgle of the saltwater spring. The clock on my nightstand read just after midnight. Only a dream, but I was sure of two things: Annabeth was in terrible danger. And Luke was responsible. SIX AN OLD DEAD FRIEND COMES TO VISIT The next morning after breakfast, I told Grover about my dream."
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,76," I stared at their bowed heads, my heart hammering, but said with midnight smoothness, “What?” "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,39, “Duly noted.” Rhys yanked open the drawers and pulled out my undergarments. He dangled the bits of midnight lace and chuckled. “I’m surprised you didn’t demand Nuala and Cerridwen buy you something else.” 
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,40, His answering smile evoked silken sheets and jasmine-scented breezes at midnight. 
00:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,midnight,24,"The sensation inside me grows warmer and spreads out from my chest, down through my body, out along my arms and legs, to the tips of my being. Instead of satisfying me, the kisses have the opposite effect, of making my need greater. I thought I was something of an expert on hunger, but this is an entirely new kind. It's the first crack of the lightning storm - the bolt hitting the tree at midnight - that brings us to our senses. It rouses Finnick as well. He sits up with a sharp cry. I see his fingers digging into the sand as he reassures himself that whatever nightmare he inhabited wasn't real."
00:00:00,Siege and Storm,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,40,"“I’m already insufferable”. * * * THE DAYS GREW LONGER. The sun stayed close beneath the horizon, and the festival of Belyanoch began in Os Alta. Even at midnight, the skies were never truly dark, and despite the fear of war and the looming threat of the Fold, the city celebrated the endless hours of twilight. In the upper town, the evenings were crowded with operas, masques, and lavish ballets. Over the bridge, raucous horse races and outdoor dances shook the streets of the lower town. An endless stream of pleasure boats bobbed through the canal, and beneath the glimmering dusk, the slow-moving water circled the capital like a jeweled bangle, alight with lanterns hung from a thousand prows."
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,44," “What about your parents?” I managed to say, slipping my feet into the midnight-blue shoes. It’d be the end of winter in the mortal lands—most shoes would be useless. Actually, my current ensemble would be useless, but only for the moments I’d be outside—bundled up. "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,47," Rhys wrote the letter for me, Cassian and Azriel chiming in with corrections, and it took us until midnight before we had a draft we all thought sounded impressive, welcoming, and threatening enough. "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,57," “I am when my brothers tag-team me,” he grumbled. He offered no warning before we vanished on a midnight wind, and then— "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,57," I had never seen water so vibrant. Green and cobalt and midnight. And for a heartbeat, a palette of paint flashed in my mind, along with the blue and yellow and white and black I might need to paint it … "
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,64," Rhys snorted, and shadows gathered around him as he loosened his grip on his power. “Nuala and Cerridwen are already on the move inside the castle. I’ll take to the skies. The two of you should go for a midnight walk—considering how hot it is.” Then he was gone with a rustle of invisible wings and a warm, dark breeze. "
00:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,Midnight,23,"It's a clock, Wiress, you were right,"" I say. ""You were right"". Relief floods her face - I guess because somebody has finally understood what she's known probably from the first tolling of the bells. ""Midnight"". ""It starts at midnight,"" I confirm. A memory struggles to surface in my brain. I see a clock."
00:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,68," In the back of my mind, a sensual male voice chuckled with midnight laughter. "
00:00:00,The Battle of the Labyrinth,Rick Riordan,midnight,5,"We glimpse things that are happening to our friends or enemies. Sometimes we even glimpse the past or the future. And at camp, my dreams were always more frequent and vivid. So I was still awake around midnight, staring at the bunk bed mattress above me, when I realized there was a strange light in the room. The saltwater fountain was glowing. I threw off the covers and walked cautiously toward it. Steam rose from the hot salt water."
00:00:00,Kingdom of Ash,Sarah J. Maas,midnight,202," Like alternating punches, Lorcan struck with them. Fire, then midnight death."

“Suit yourself,” said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled by his amiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat down I began to feel sleepy."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,123," “The Midnight Theater and the Followers,” Emma said. “We want to know about them.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,120," “I feel farther away now than I’ve ever felt. Even though we actually have a connection, even though we’re following up on it. I don’t see how their deaths could be connected to the Midnight Theater or the Lottery. I don’t see—”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,113," “M for Midnight?” she said, pointing at the seat backs."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,midnight,98, “Right now?” Emma said. “Have you got a midnight date?”
00:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke,midnight,57,"Paula was just the right size for a spy. It didn’t seem all that long ago since Meggie herself had been able to hide unnoticed under a table. 28  Going Home  My library was dukedom large enough. William Shakespeare,  The Tempest  It was almost midnight by the time Elinor finally saw her garden gate beside the road. The lights down by the banks of the lake stood side by side like a caravan of glow-worms, trembling as they were reflected in the black water. It was good to be home again. Even the wind that blew on Elinor’s face as she got out to open the gate felt familiar."
00:00:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman,midnight,1,"I leaf through the newspaper to the calendar section. There’s a small blurb about Shooting Star, with an even smaller picture of the four of them, next to a big article about Bikini and a huge picture of the band’s lead singer: punk-rock diva Brooke Vega. The bit about them basically says that local band Shooting Star is opening for Bikini on the Portland leg of Bikini’s national tour. It doesn’t mention the even-bigger-to-me news that last night Shooting Star headlined at a club in Seattle and, according to the text Adam sent me at midnight, sold out the place. “Are you going tonight? ” Dad asks. “I was planning to."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,124, Julian shrugged. “Who else would you be?” He tilted his head to the side. “Maybe you know something about the Lottery at the Midnight Theater?”
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,midnight,21," One day she and Julian would both be married, to other people. There would be no crawling into each other’s beds. There would be no exchanging of secrets at midnight. Their closeness wouldn’t break, but it would bend and stretch into a new shape. She would have to learn to live with that."
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,105," James slid her coat from her shoulders and hung it on the rack by the door, along with her damp scarf. “Well, Magnus isn’t getting here until midnight,” he said lightly, “and I don’t know about you, but I’m starving. Meet you in the study?”"
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,103,"She won’t like it that I let you into the caravan”. He smiled. “It’s always better to respect a lady’s personal space. James, Cordelia, I’ll meet you at Curzon Street at midnight. Now off you all go—no more shopping, dallying, or skulking about. The Shadow Market’s a dangerous place, especially after moonrise”."
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,87," It had been a long night, both because of the rain that had begun shortly after midnight, and because as he passed along Brewer Street, he had nearly run into a patrol of Shadowhunters: four or five men bundled in gear and heavy coats. He slipped away from them, through Golden Square. The last thing he wanted was to be caught, and likely censured. He could not—would not—rest until the killer was apprehended."
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,86," Thomas was buttoning his coat as he crossed the kitchen—dark, now, as midnight had come and the place was blissfully free of domestic staff. He had crept out of the drawing room without the others noticing, caught up as they were in their chatter and card games. Even Christopher, on watch by the door, hadn’t noticed as Thomas had gathered up his gear jacket and bolas and crept down the hall."
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,44,"She only shrugged. She didn’t know what had gotten into James either. Since it was just family at home, he had dressed casually—she had even teased him that his midnight-colored velvet jacket was something Matthew might wear—but the moment that they had crossed the threshold, his manners had been nothing short of exquisitely formal. He had complimented Sona on the beautiful flower arrangements and the deliciousness of the food, and even told Alastair that his hair looked nice. Now he had drawn out Elias by insisting on hearing his stories of past heroism."
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,33, Ariadne raised her chin. She was wearing her newest dress—a midnight-blue confection with matching ribbon strung through her hair. The color of Anna’s eyes. She knew Anna would take note. “Would you honor me with this dance?”
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,midnight,14," But Emma didn’t want to think about Julian being sad, not now, not when he was so close to coming home. Now that it was past midnight, he was technically coming home tomorrow. She felt a shiver of excitement and relief."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,148," To be met with a sheet of blue-green fire. Sterling was standing behind it, still clasping the green-haired girl. Her eyes met Emma’s. She had a slight, elfin face—a recollection of seeing her at the Midnight Theater touched the edge of Emma’s memory."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,150," “Yeah, about that,” Cristina said. “How did you end up joining that cult or whatever it is at the Midnight Theater?”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,151," Sterling yelled something incomprehensible. Emma slammed on the brakes as the headlights skittered across the trampled brush in front of the building. The figures were illuminated, lit up like daylight. Some were familiar. She recognized the curly-haired boy from the band at the Midnight Theater, his face set in a stony snarl. Beside him was a woman—dark hair, red lips—who raised a hand with a gun in it—"
00:00:00,The Battle of the Labyrinth,Rick Riordan,midnight,7,"“They’ll be fine,” Annabeth said. “Come on. Let’s worry about how we’re going to stay alive”. *** It was still light when we got into the woods, but the shadows from the trees made it feel like midnight. It was cold, too, even in summer. Annabeth and I found tracks almost immediately—scuttling marks made by something with a lot of legs. We began to follow the trail."
00:00:00,Lord of Shadows,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,31," “It depends how long he had to wait for the right moment to step on the path,” said Cristina. “Such moments come and go. Midnight is only one of them.”"

00:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke,midnight,30,"I was just packing. I’d decided it was safer to leave, since I didn’t want to be driving Basta and Capricorn out of my house at sword-point again. Dustfinger’s reappearance showed that I was right to feel anxious. It was well after midnight when he turned up, but I couldn’t sleep anyway. ’ Mo stroked Meggie’s hair. ‘You weren’t sleeping well then either. You had bad dreams, however much I tried to keep them away with my stories."
00:00:00,Lord of Shadows,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,11," “He was the one who got my father involved in all that stuff with the Followers and the Midnight Theater,” said Kit, his tone almost thoughtful. “It’s Malcolm’s fault he died.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,219,"Many of the places Emma goes are real or based on real places in Los Angeles, but some are imaginary. Canter’s Deli exists, but the Midnight Theater doesn’t. Poseidon’s Trident is based on the seafood shack Neptune’s Net, but the Net doesn’t have showers out back. Malcolm’s house and Wells’s are based on real houses. I grew up in Los Angeles, so in many ways this is the L.A. I always imagined as a child, full of magic."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,191," She thought of him winking at her in the Midnight Theater. I never knew his name, she thought, and then whirled back around."
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,179," Ty gave him a superior look. “We looked at everything going back a hundred years,” he said. “But Tavvy’s book said Lady Midnight was in love with someone she was forbidden to love.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,179," “Who she was,” Ty said. “Our Lady Midnight. Tavvy’s book reminded me of a story I read in one of the Blackthorn history books—”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,178, The rest of the family had been in the library. They had torn through piles of books in search of information about Lady Midnight.
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,174," “To where? The library? Everyone has been reading and searching all day for more information about Lady Midnight. We will find something, but we have plenty of people to look at pages.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,164," Emma said, “‘First thirteen and then the last.’ He’s killed thirteen. He’s got one last one to go and then he’s done. He’ll have enough magic to bring back Lady Midnight.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,164," “Because she was a Blackthorn,” said Tavvy. “Lady Midnight. They called her that because she had long black hair, but she had the same eyes as the rest of us. Look.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,164," “Midnight,” said Tavvy. “Like the theater you went to. I heard Mark say the rhyme and I just remembered I read it before.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,164," “Great-Aunt Marjorie gave it to me,” Tavvy said. “I like most of the stories. The one about the first parabatai is good, but some of them are sad and scary, like the one about Tobias Herondale. And the one about Lady Midnight is the saddest.”"
00:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare,Midnight,162," “Yes. She saw me and raced off. I followed her to her house, managed to convince her to tell me everything she knew about the Midnight Theater, the Followers, the Lottery. It wasn’t much, but I learned that she had been chosen by the Lottery. That she had been the one who killed Stanley Wells, knowing that if she didn’t, she would be tortured and killed herself.”"
00:00:00,Chain of Iron,Cassandra Clare,midnight,11,"She sank back with a sigh against the blue silk seat, suddenly tired. It had been a long night. Anna had slipped away an hour or so after midnight with Lily, a vampire from Peking. Lucie had stood firm—she’d wanted to remain at the Ruelle as long as Cordelia was amused; she knew her friend was half dreading the next day. She couldn’t blame her. Not that people didn’t get married for all sorts of reasons of expediency rather than love, but even if it was temporary, it was very dramatic."
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,87,"Not that others weren’t kind as well. When Anna brought James a stylish new necktie to cheer him, she brought one for Matthew. When Lucie smuggled in midnight tarts from the kitchen, there were extras for Matthew. It was possible, as a result, that Matthew was never going home. James could hardly blame him: Charles had certainly been a pill lately. Everyone was hailing Christopher as a hero for having created the antidote to the Mandikhor poison—a tale made even more romantic by the fact that Christopher had been stricken down and healed himself."
00:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,14,"I took a deep breath, pulled the kefta off the screen, and slipped it on. It was lighter than it looked, and like the other clothes, it fit perfectly. I fastened the little hidden buttons in the front and stepped back to try to look at myself in the mirror above the basin. The kefta was deepest midnight blue and fell nearly to my feet. The sleeves were wide, and though it was a lot like a coat, it was so elegant I felt as if I were wearing a gown. Then I noticed the embroidery at the cuffs. Like all Grisha, the Etherealki indicated their designation within their order by color of embroidery: pale blue for Tidemakers, red for Inferni, and silver for Squallers."
00:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,20,"Occasionally, I caught her glaring at me or giggling behind her hand with her little group of Summoner friends, but I tried not to let it get to me. Still, I couldn’t shake the sense of my own failure. When the first snow came, I woke to find a new kefta waiting for me on my door. It was made of heavy midnight blue wool and had a hood lined in thick golden fur. I put it on, but it was hard not to feel like a fraud. After picking at my breakfast, I made the familiar walk to Baghra’s cottage. The gravel paths, cleared of snow by Inferni, sparkled beneath the weak winter sun."
00:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,23,"Ana Kuya had always told us that the banya was barbaric, an excuse for peasants to drink kvas and engage in wanton behavior. But I was beginning to realize that old Ana had been a bit of a snob. I sat in the steam for as long as I could bear the heat and then plunged, squealing, into the snow with the others, before running back inside to do it all over again. I stayed until long past midnight, laughing and gasping, trying to clear my head. When I stumbled back to my room, I fell into bed, my skin damp and pink, my hair in wet tangles. I felt flushed and boneless, but my mind was still whirring. I focused and summoned a warm wash of sunlight, making it dance in slivers across the painted ceiling, letting the sure rush of power soothe my nerves."
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,55,"She’s okay”. He wants to believe it, but he doesn’t, and it’s worse than if he’d said nothing. “No one is ever okay”. ***  It’s well after midnight, but no one is sleeping. We’re on our third pot of coffee. I’ve made the last two, which is only right, since I’ve been the one drinking most of it. Asher and Addison and Mr. Ward got back an hour ago."

""Perhaps the King under the Mountain is forging gold,"" said another. ""It is long since he went north."
00:00:00,The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien,midnight,12,"Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the back and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service. The dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble. Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down in fright."
00:00:00,The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien,midnight,8,"Hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in woods, as 1. have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming. He had picked his way stealthily 'for some distance, when he noticed a place of dense black shadow ahead of him black even for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were speaking one to another."
00:00:00,Siege and Storm,Leigh Bardugo,midnight,11,"His eyes were a muddy green, his hair a peculiar shade of red. His nose looked like it had been broken and badly set several times. At one point, he caught me studying him, and I could have sworn he turned his face away from the light. When we finally left Sturmhond’s cabin, it was past midnight. I herded Mal above deck to a secluded spot by the ship’s prow. I knew there were men on watch in the foretop above us, but I didn’t know when I’d have another chance to get him alone. “I like him,” Mal was saying, a little unsteady on his feet from the wine."
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,25,But she doesn’t ask. She just keeps sanding and I won’t stop her. I despise sanding. It’s after midnight by the time we call it quits. I don’t know how her hands even held up this long. She sanded the hell out of everything I gave her. I never did ask her what was wrong earlier.
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,21,"” Of course I do, and you know that I do. You just want to ask for dramatic effect and then you’re going to tell me anyway. “This address came up again and again and again‌—‌at nine o’clock, ten o’clock, eleven o’clock. Sometimes midnight”. Sounds about right. I don’t confirm or deny. I’ll let her keep talking until she asks me something outright."
00:00:00,Project Hail Mary,Andy Weir,Midnight,22, Midnight. Darkness everywhere. The army guys changed shift to two guys I didn’t know. I missed Steve.
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,44," It was nearing midnight when the five of them—Lucie, James, Matthew, Thomas, and Christopher—finally returned to the Institute. Lucie regarded the bright-lit windows curiously as they spilled into the courtyard. It was unusual at this hour for all the lamps to be on."
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,34,"“James has been slandered by Tatiana Blackthorn and my rotten older brother is backing her up to the hilt; James has gone off to rendezvous with Grace. I am here to get squiffy and try to forget what a foolish thing my parabatai is doing”. He glanced at his watch. “Also, I have to be at Fleet Street by midnight”."
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,33," “I am always going to the devil,” said Matthew, a glint in his eye. “I shall be at the tavern by midnight. Join me there when you can.”"
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,33,"He bent to rub Oscar’s head and said, “Thomas, Christopher, you handle the laboratory work. Matthew, I will find you when I return from meeting Grace, and we will go to the Devil”. “I am always going to the devil,” said Matthew, a glint in his eye. “I shall be at the tavern by midnight. Join me there when you can”. James excused himself and hurried from the house. The letter in his pocket seemed to beat against his chest like a second heart."
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,14," It was long past midnight. Tessa Herondale sat in front of the mirror in the bedroom she had shared with her husband for twenty-three years, and brushed her hair. The windows were closed, but soft summer air seeped in under the sill."
00:00:00,People We Meet on Vacation,Emily Henry,midnight,100,"My first piece is about a new bowling alley in Brooklyn with an old-school feel. Alex went with me to scope the place out, and I knew as soon as I spotted Dolores in the next lane over, personalized gold ball and matching gloves and a halo of frizzy gray hair, that she was someone who could teach me things. A bucket of beer, a long conversation, and a bowling lesson later, and I had everything I needed for the article, but Alex and Dolores and I walked over to the hot dog place down the street anyway, hung out until nearly midnight."
00:00:00,People We Meet on Vacation,Emily Henry,midnight,8," Any chance you’re looking to get out of town? I write. That seems good. It’s clear what I’m asking, but pretty casual, with an easy out. But the longer I study the words, the weirder I feel about being so casual. About pretending nothing happened and the two of us are still close friends who can plan a trip in such an informal forum as a postmidnight text."
00:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,midnight,61," We left at midnight, when Pete finally pronounced that they should be getting home to the Labradors and Maggie started whisking around to clean up, but we were too tipsy to drive, so we walked through the heat and mosquitoes."
00:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,midnight,55," He was still working at midnight when Shadi texted me: Well, that’s it. I’m in love. RIP me."
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,7,"I don’t want to be awake anymore. ***  I made it through my second Monday at school. You’d think I’d be drained just from the constant suck of it all, but apparently not, because I still can’t sleep. I’ve been in bed for two hours now; I know it’s after midnight but I can’t see the clock from here so I’m not sure exactly what time it is. I think about the composition book tucked under the mattress beneath me. I reach down and shove my hand under to touch it. My three and a half pages are done, every word accounted for, but still no sleep."
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,9,"CHAPTER 10  Josh  Drew pulls into my driveway just after midnight and I know immediately that no good can come of this. I put down the pencil I’ve been using to mark down measurements with and watch him get out of the car and walk towards the garage. “Dude, I need a favor”. “Of course you do”."
00:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay,midnight,17,"Which makes me the dumbass I am. I eventually sit down and work on checking cut lines on some beams I need for a job I have and then planing them. It’s quiet work so I can do it at night, plus I have to stay busy or I’m going to end up in a staring contest with this girl in a lame attempt to read her mind or something. At midnight she jumps off of the counter and heads back down the driveway without a word or any sort of acknowledgement, just the way she came. ***  I don’t pay much attention in my first three classes and no one notices. At lunch I watch for her, wondering if she’ll look at me. I never do see her cross the courtyard, but when I get up to head in to the shop wing just before the bell, she’s leaning against the wall with Clay Whitaker."
00:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry,midnight,24," When I told him I’d never been out of the country, he immediately suggested a spontaneous road trip to Canada. I’d thought he was kidding basically until we pulled up to the duty-free shop on the far side of the border around midnight. “There,” he said with his model grin, all shiny and guileless. “Next we need to get you somewhere they’ll actually stamp your passport.”"
00:00:00,Artemis,Andy Weir,midnight,57," “Doesn’t have to make sense to you.” I checked my Gizmo. “We have three hours and fifty-two minutes left until midnight, by the way. Then it won’t be ‘evening’ anymore.”"
00:00:00,Artemis,Andy Weir,midnight,34," I connected the positive and negative poles of the main power line with my contraption. Nothing happened, of course. The relay was open. But once the alarm went off (set for midnight that evening), the relay would close and the battery would short out. And the short would bypass the breaker box entirely, so the normal fail-safes wouldn’t work."
00:00:00,Artemis,Andy Weir,midnight,11," Once I’d taken care of the 416,922?, I’d still be making a bunch of money. I could afford a nice place. My shithole coffin only cost eight thousand a month, but I couldn’t even stand up in it. And I wanted my own bathroom. That doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it is. I realized that around the hundredth time I had to walk down a public hallway in my nightie to take a midnight piss."
00:00:00,Artemis,Andy Weir,midnight,11," I’d be making over 85,000? a month. And that’s just from tours. I’d also try to get a job as a probe wrangler. They’re the EVA masters who bring the probes to the freight airlock and unload them. Then I’d have access to shipments before Nakoshi inspected them. I could sneak contraband in right then or set it aside for later recovery with a sneaky midnight EVA. Whatever worked best. Point is, I could cut Nakoshi out entirely."
00:00:00,Chain of Gold,Cassandra Clare,midnight,72," Cordelia was speechless. She had certainly expected to get Cortana back, but not for James to show up in Cornwall Gardens after midnight."
00:00:00,Queen of Air and Darkness,Cassandra Clare,midnight,21,"Nearly. Without Emma, she knew, the Institute would never be normal for her. Emma had been the first person she’d met in Los Angeles; Emma had befriended her instantly and without hesitation. Her introduction to L.A. had been going to all of Emma’s favorite places, her secret beaches and canyon trails; it had been driving in the car with her with the radio on and their hair down, hot dogs at Pink’s, pie at the Apple Pan at midnight."
00:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke,midnight,13,"And why, may I ask? ’  Dustfinger winked at Meggie. ‘Well, I’ve promised to put on a little show for this young lady,’ he said. ‘It begins about an hour before midnight. ’  ‘Oh yes? ’ Elinor dabbed some sauce off her lips with her napkin. ‘A little show."
00:00:00,Queen of Air and Darkness,Cassandra Clare,midnight,40, “Were you waiting up for us?” Mark demanded. “It’s past midnight.”

00:00:00,City of Lost Souls,Cassandra Clare,midnight,52,"Amatis was Luke's sister; he knew her; and that moment of disbelief might have been the end of him if Magnus hadn't jumped in front of him, shoving him backward. Blue fire shot from Magnus's hand, but Amatis was faster than the warlock, too. She spun away from the blaze and under Magnus's arm, and Simon caught the flash of moonlight off the blade of her knife. Magnus's eyes widened in shock as her midnight-colored blade drove downward, slicing through his armor. She jerked it back, the blade now slick with reflective blood; Isabelle screamed as Magnus collapsed to his knees. Simon tried to turn toward him, but the surge and pressure of the fighting crowd was carrying him away. He cried out Magnus's name as Amatis bent over the fallen warlock and raised the dagger a second time, aiming for his heart."
00:00:00,The Host,Stephenie Meyer,midnight,35,"Ian said. Doc took my wrist, and I didn't fight him. I looked away as the needle bit into my skin, looked at Ian. His eyes were midnight in the dark. They tightened at the look of betrayal in mine. ""Sorry,"" he muttered. It was the last thing I heard."
00:00:00,The Silver Chair,C. S. Lewis,midnight,8,"And she tucked Jill up and said good night. I know nothing so disagreeable as being kissed by a giantess. Jill thought the same, but was asleep in five minutes. The rain fell steadily all the evening and all the night, dashing against the windows of the castle, and Jill never heard it but slept deeply, past supper time and past midnight. And then came the deadest hour of the night and nothing stirred but mice in the house of the giants. At that hour there came to Jill a dream. It seemed to her that she awoke in the same room and saw the fire, sunk low and red, and in the firelight the great wooden horse."
00:00:00,The Host,Stephenie Meyer,midnight,60,"The movement of my head on my neck felt so odd. It didn't feel like it used to, but at the same time it felt the way it had always felt. My searching eyes found the blue I'd been looking for. Sapphire, snow, and midnight. ""Ian? Ian, where am I""? The sound of the voice coming out of my throat frightened me."
00:00:00,Queen of Air and Darkness,Cassandra Clare,midnight,25," Cristina had waited until midnight before putting on a dress and denim jacket and going to see Mark. It was strange to have her own clothes back, her room with its árbol de vida, her own sheets and blankets. It wasn’t quite coming home, but it was close."
00:00:00,Twilight,Stephenie Meyer,midnight,29,"
Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici."
00:00:00,The Silver Chair,C. S. Lewis,midnight,4,"I'll be back in two twos. Tu-whoo""! And without waiting for an answer, he was gone. If Jill had been more used to adventures, she might have doubted the Owl's word, but this never occurred to her: and in the exciting idea of a midnight escape she forgot her sleepiness. She changed back into sweater and shorts there was a guide's knife on the belt of the shorts which might come in useful - and added a few of the things that had been left in the room for her by the girl with the willowy hair. She chose a short cloak that came down to her knees and had a hood (""just the thing, if it rains,"" she thought), a few handkerchiefs and a comb. Then she sat down and waited."

Then Pattertwig came back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after that Pattertwig asked if he could take any messages to other friends. ""For I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground,"" he said. Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gave Pattertwig messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling them all to come to a feast and council on Dancing Lawn at midnight three nights ahead. ""And you'd better tell the three Bulgies too,"" added Trumpkin. ""We forgot to mention it to them"". Their next visit was to the Seven Brothers of Shuddering Wood."

Lewis,midnight,2,"There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. ""Not that it isn't always winter now,"" he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time."
00:00:00,The Mark of Athena,Rick Riordan,midnight,45,"Tempest and Arion also hadn’t shown themselves. Maybe they didn’t want to venture into the Mediterranean. If so, Percy couldn’t blame them. Finally around midnight, after the ninth or tenth aerial attack, Jason turned to him. “How about you get some sleep? I’ll keep blasting stuff out of the sky as long as I can. Then we can go by sea for a while, and you can take point”."
00:00:00,The Son of Neptune,Rick Riordan,midnight,51,"He picked up the receiver and punched in a New York number—his mom’s apartment. Voice mail. Percy should have figured.

Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often woke up during the night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep. I waited for his light to go on, straining my eyes to see it flood the hall. It stayed off, and I breathed again."

We saw the battle before we were close enough to make out individual fighters. It was well after midnight now, but the bridge blazed with light. Cars were burning. Arcs of fire streamed in both directions as flaming arrows and spears sailed through the air. We came in for a low pass, and I saw the Apollo campers retreating."
00:00:00,The Battle of the Labyrinth,Rick Riordan,midnight,18,"Before the three-bodied man could respond, Nico di Angelo came out of the glass doors onto the porch. “Geryon, I won’t wait for—” He froze when he saw us.

I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle."

Jill rejoined Eustace and they shook one another by both hands and took in great deep breaths of the free midnight air. And a warm cloak was brought for Eustace and hot drinks, for both. While they were sipping it, the Dwarfs had already got all the snow and all the sods off a large strip of the hillside round the original hole, and the pickaxes and spades were now going as merrily as the feet of Fauns and Dryads had been going in the dance ten minutes before. Only ten minutes!"

The hands had long ago stopped spinning, the time seemingly frozen at midnight. The initials J. T. S. were carved on the back in elegant script. “Why? ” she whispered."

By which I take it you mean we survived? ” “Well…” “Faeries,” Jace went on, as if Simon hadn’t spoken, “are the offspring of demons and angels, with the beauty of angels and the viciousness of demons. A vampire might attack you, if you entered its domain, but a faerie could make you dance until you died with your legs ground down into stumps, trick you into a midnight swim and drag you screaming underwater until your lungs burst, fill your eyes with faerie dust until you gouged them out at the roots—” “Jace! ” Clary snapped, cutting him off mid-rant. “Shut up. Jesus."
00:00:00,City of Ashes,Cassandra Clare,midnight,21,"They fell, a rain of hot coals from the sky, and she cowered, throwing up her arms. One fell just in front of her, a hurtling bonfire, but when it struck the ground it became a boy: It was Jace, all in burning gold with his gold eyes and gold hair, and white-gold wings sprouted from his back, wider and more thickly feathered than any bird’s. He smiled like a cat and pointed behind her, and Clary turned to see that a dark-haired boy—was it Simon? —was standing there, and wings spread from his back as well, feathered black as midnight, and each feather was tipped with blood. Clary woke up gasping, her hands knotted in Jace’s shirt. It was dark in the bedroom, ambient streetlight streaming from the one narrow window beside the bed. She sat up."

She came over to the window beside Isabelle and drew the curtains firmly shut. “It’s already almost midnight; who knows when they’ll get back from the Council? There’s no point staying—” The pendant at Isabelle’s throat pulsed again, sharply—and then the window Aline was standing in front of shattered inward. Aline screamed as hands reached through the gaping hole—not hands, really, Isabelle saw with the clarity of shock, but huge, scaled claws, streaked with blood and blackish fluid. They seized Aline and yanked her through the smashed window before she could utter a second scream."

And I think some words that Ginger has scattered among the Dwarfs are chiefly to blame for the scurvy return they made you. And I'll tell you why. One of those dreadful midnight meetings had just broken up the night before last and I'd gone a bit of the way home when I found I'd left my pipe behind. It was a real good 'un, an old favourite, so I went back to look for it. But before I got to the place where I'd been sitting (it was black as pitch there) I heard a cat's voice say Mew and a Calormene voice say `here. ."

Lowering his bloody hand, he gazed out across the horrified crowd, his eyes coming to rest at last on Luke. He spoke slowly. “I will give you until tomorrow at midnight to consider my terms. At that time I will bring my army, in all its force, to Brocelind Plain. If I have not yet received a message of surrender from the Clave, I will march with my army here to Alicante, and this time we will leave nothing living. You have that long to consider my terms."

You think he wouldn’t take you with him to the lake because he needed you to stay here and open the gate at midnight? Like he didn’t know you wouldn’t be able to wait. He didn’t take you with him because he’s ashamed to stand up in front of the Angel and show him what he’s done. Show him the thing he made."

If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren't meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you're found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o'clock in the morning. )  ""We must put them off their guard, though,"" said Scrubb.

Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the witch; but his face was stern and everyone's ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared. After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass), they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o'clock they were on the march and set off in a northeasterly direction, walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go. During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign. ""As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,"" he said, ""the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for a siege.

In between, a square space of level grass had been staked for the combat. At the two far corners stood Glozelle and Sopespian with drawn swords. At the near corners were Giant Wimbleweather and the Bulgy Bear, who in spite of all their warnings was sucking his paws and looking, to tell the truth, uncommonly silly."
02:00:00,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,C. S. Lewis,two o'clock,13,"Probably everyone had the same reason but no one said it out loud. For it was really a rather nasty choice. One could hardly bear to sit all night next to those three terrible hairy objects which, if not dead, were certainly not alive in the ordinary sense. On the other hand, to sit at the far end, so that you would see them less and less as the night grew darker, and wouldn't know if they were moving, and perhaps wouldn't see them at all by about two o'clock no, it was not to be thought of. So they sauntered round and round the table saying, ""What about here""? and ""Or perhaps a bit further on,"" or, ""Why not on this side""? till at last they settled down somewhere about the middle but nearer to the sleepers than to the other end."

About two o'clock in the afternoon, well victualled and watered (though they thought they would need neither food nor drink) and with Reepicheep's coracle on board, the boat pulled away from the Dawn Treader to row through the endless carpet of lilies. The Dawn Trader flew all her flags and hung out her shields to honour their departure. Tall and big and homelike she looked from their low position with the lilies all round them. And before she was out of sight they saw her turn and begin rowing slowly westward."

03:00:00,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe",C. S. Lewis,three o'clock,9,"It wasn't a very good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel. The first thing he realized when he got outside and found the snow falling all round him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now. The next thing he realized was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn't reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn't so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river. It was pretty bad when he reached the far side."
03:00:00,Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,three o'clock,19,"They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire. The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect. As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for that purpose."

Elizabeth Gelman, the youthful head of research, was supposed to report on her findings, but they had to delay for the afternoon feeding in the nursery. Malcolm had watched them feed a baby gorilla, which spit up like a human baby, and a koala, and then the very cute snow-leopard cub. ""Sorry about that,"" Gelman said."

They had found no trace of Eustace but had seen a dead dragon in a valley. They tried to make the best of it and everyone assured everyone else that there were not likely to he more dragons about, and that one which was dead at about three o'clock that afternoon (which was when they had seen it) would hardly have been killing people a very few hours before. ""Unless it ate the little brat and died of him: he'd poison anything,"" said Rhince. But he said this under his breath and no one heard it.

04:00:00,Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,four o'clock,43,"His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;—and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air. How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly told. This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;— and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire."

""I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton"". He engaged to be with them by four o'clock. Chapter 15 Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home. On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect."
04:00:00,Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,four o'clock,37,"Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;—when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy. Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted, with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the probability of an entire recovery. Elinor could not be cheerful."

05:00:00,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,five o'clock,4,"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes. Chapter 8 At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike."

We spend a fitful night, woken by one another's nightmares, minds buzzing with the next day's plans. I'm relieved when five o'clock rolls around and we can begin whatever this day holds for us. We eat a mishmash of our remaining food - canned peaches, crackers, and snails - leaving one can of salmon for Tigris as meager thanks for all she's done. The gesture seems to touch her in some way. Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies into action."
05:00:00,Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,five o'clock,37,"Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought. Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational. She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could not come, for some other advice, when the former—but not till after five o'clock—arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them. With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed."

We watch as the claw dips down five different times to retrieve the pieces of one body, torn apart. It's impossible to tell who it was. Whatever happens at six o'clock, I never want to know. Peeta draws a new map on a leaf, adding a JJ for jabberjays in the four-to-five-o'clock section and simply writing beast in the one where we saw the tribute collected in pieces. We now have a good idea of what seven of the hours will bring. And if there's any positive to the jabberjay attack, it's that it let us know where we are on the clock face again."

It seems like only minutes later when Jackson shakes me awake, tells me I'm on watch. It's six o'clock, and in one hour we must be on our way. Jackson tells me to eat a can of food and keep an eye on Pollux, who's insisted on being on guard the entire night. ""He can't sleep down here"".

All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong. She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course, in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was— but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt. The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected back.

At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;— and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.

ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing— What I felt was dreadful! —My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage. Now you know all"". Elinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a feeling, affectionate temper."

It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:- ""Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.

As always, it was Aziza who shook her awake for morning namaz.

An experienced warrior and huntsman like Tirian can always wake up at the time he wants.

It seemed only a moment later when he woke but he knew by the light and the very feel of things that he had timed his sleep exactly. He got up, put on his helmet-and-turban (he had slept in his mail shirt), and then shook the other two till they woke up.

At about ten o'clock the first tiny snow flakes came loitering down and settled on Jill's arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white.

So they had to wait while Bree had a snack and a drink, and of course Hwin and the children had a snack and a drink too. It must have been nearly eleven o'clock in the morning before they finally got going again. And even then Bree took things much more gently than yesterday. It was really Hwin, though she was the weaker and more tired of the two, who set the pace. The valley itself, with its brown, cool river, and grass and moss and wild flowers and rhododendrons, was such a pleasant place that it made you want to ride slowly."
11:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,eleven o'clock,25,"""Well, that explains a lot,"" says Beetee. I look at Peeta and can't help biting my lip to keep from laughing since it explains absolutely nothing to anyone but Beetee. About this time we hear the sound of clicks rising from the sector adjacent to us. That means it's eleven o'clock. It's far louder in the jungle than it was on the beach last night. We all listen intently. ""It's not mechanical,"" Beetee says decidedly."
11:00:00,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,eleven o'clock,38,"You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted."
12:00:00,Prince Caspian,C. S. Lewis, noon,15,"Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over the country with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines - including, of course, the prisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would henceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other creatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditions might do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another home. Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Ford of Beruna by noon on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of head-scratching among the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back. They were already making friends with the creatures."
12:00:00,The Lost Hero,Rick Riordan, noon,57,"Not even a survivable chance. Just their best chance. They couldn’t sit there all day and talk about it, though. It had to be close to noon—the giant’s deadline—and the ground was still trying to pull them down. Leo’s knees had already sunk two inches into the dirt. Leo looked at the construction equipment and got a crazy idea. He brought out the little toy he’d made on the climb, and he realized what it could do—if he was lucky, which he almost never was."
12:00:00,The Mark of Athena,Rick Riordan, noon,49,"The few times someone approached them on the street and asked a question, Percy just looked at them in confusion, and they switched to English. Next discovery: the Italians used euros, and Percy didn’t have any. He regretted this as soon as he found a tourist shop that sold sodas. By then it was almost noon, getting really hot, and Percy was starting to wish he had a trireme filled with Diet Coke. Annabeth solved the problem. She dug around in her backpack, brought out Daedalus’s laptop, and typed in a few commands. A plastic card ejected from a slot in the side."

I don’t care which. Just be at the summit by noon on the solstice, and you may collect your father and go in peace”. “I can’t,” Piper said. “You can’t ask me—” “To betray that foolish boy Valdez, who always irritated you and is now hiding secrets from you? To give up a boyfriend you never really had?"
12:00:00,The Last Olympian,Rick Riordan, noon,46,"She winked at me with red glowing eyes. No one else seemed to notice her, but I realized maybe she preferred it that way. ""And now,"" Chiron said, ""early to bed! Remember, you must vacate your cabins by noon tomorrow unless you've made arrangements to stay the year with us. The cleaning harpies will eat any stragglers, and I'd hate to end the summer on a sour note""! The next morning, Annabeth and I stood at the top of Half-Blood Hill. We watched the buses and vans pull away, taking most of the campers back to the real world."
12:00:00,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,C. S. Lewis, noon,8,"It was a tiny boat, barely four feet long, and the paddle which still lay in it was in proportion. They thought that either it had been made for a child or else that the people of that country had been Dwarfs. Reepicheep decided to keep it, as it was just the right size for him; so it was taken on board. They called that land Burnt Island, and sailed away before noon. For some five days they ran before a south-south-east wind, out of sight of all lands and seeing neither fish nor gull. Then they had a day when it rained hard till the afternoon. Eustace lost two games of chess to Reepicheep and began to get like his old and disagreeable self again, and Edmund said he wished they could have gone to America with Susan."
12:00:00,The Lost Hero,Rick Riordan, noon,47,"Then after we started the quest, Enceladus sent me another warning: He told me he wanted you two dead. He wants me to lead you to a mountain. I don’t know exactly which one, but it’s in the Bay Area—I could see the Golden Gate Bridge from the summit. I have to be there by noon on the solstice, tomorrow. An exchange”. She couldn’t meet her friends’ eyes. She waited for them to yell at her, or turn their backs, or kick her out into the snowstorm."

""The Captain can tell you better than I,"" said Caspian, so Drinian got out his chart and spread it on the table. ""That's our position,"" he said, laying his finger on it. ""Or was at noon today. We had a fair wind from Cair Paravel and stood a little north for Galma, which we made on the next day. We were in port for a week, for the Duke of Galma made a great tournament for His Majesty and there he unhorsed many knights - ""  ""And got a few nasty falls myself, Drinian. Some of the bruises are there still,"" put in Caspian."

The sun was so high, it could’ve been noon. “I love breakfast,” Frank said. “I’d eat breakfast, breakfast, and breakfast if I could. Though, um, I’m sure the food here isn’t as good as Hazel’s”."
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,6,"
It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon."

How about we try your credit card again? ” Even though it was noon, the place was empty. They picked a table outside by the river, and a waiter hurried over. He looked a bit surprised to see them—especially when they said they wanted lunch. “American?"
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,6,"Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one’s parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem’s pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone."
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,2,"In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum."

Or…” The god’s face suddenly went slack. “Or a trap."

“I wouldn’t be too certain of that,” I said. Jem’s free dispensation of my pledge irked me, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. “Yeah Walter, I won’t jump on you again. Don’t you like butterbeans? Our Cal’s a real good cook.”"
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,12,"
By late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when Jem and I raced each other up the sidewalk to meet Atticus coming home from work, I didn’t give him much of a race. It was our habit to run meet Atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance. Atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace; he was full of questions about school. My replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me."
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,17,"
One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Man’s Family, we did not see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled magazine against his knee. The sun said twelve noon."
12:00:00,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee, noon,32,"
Calpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school that day, we’d learn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard."
12:00:00,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,C. S. Lewis, noon,11,"But the Magician could tell them nothing about seas or lands further east. He did, however, tell them that about seven years before a Narnian ship had put in at his waters and that she had on board the lords Revilian, Argoz, Mavramorn and Rhoop: so they judged that the golden man they had seen lying in Deathwater must be the Lord Restimar. Next day, the Magician magically mended the stern of the Dawn Treader where it had been damaged by the Sear Serpent and loaded her with useful gifts. There was a most friendly parting, and when she sailed, two hours after noon, all the Dufflepuds paddled out with her to the harbour mouth, and cheered until she was out of sound of their cheering."
12:00:00,The Host,Stephenie Meyer, noon,9,"Miracles don't work that way. I'll never lose you. I'll never let you get away from me"". She brought me back to the present-to the thin ribbon of the highway winding through the Arizona wasteland, baking under the fierce noon sun-without my choosing to return. I stared at the empty place ahead and felt the empty place inside. Her thought sighed faintly in my head: You never know how much time you'll have. The tears I was crying belonged to both of us."

""Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,"" he said politely."
12:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry, noon,38, TUX TONIGHT? GUS wrote at noon on Saturday.
12:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry, noon,33," GUS DIDN’T APPEAR at the kitchen table at noon on Sunday. I figured that was a bad sign—that what had happened had destroyed the only friendship I had in this town. Really, one of only several friendships I had the world over, since Jacques and my couple of friends, it had turned out, had no use for Just Me."
12:00:00,Beach Read,Emily Henry, noon,28,"Gus and I made a habit of writing at our respective kitchen tables around noon, and most days we took turns holding up notes. They became more and more elaborate. It was obvious that while some were spontaneous, others were planned—written out earlier in the day, or even the night before. Whenever inspiration struck."
12:00:00,The Sea of Tranquility,Katja Millay, noon,37,"“I figured I should get something out of the intervention since I didn’t take the phone. Besides, I spend so much time doing your laundry that I haven’t gotten to any of mine”. She buckles her seat belt and we’re off without a word about last night. We hit three antique stores by noon and I still haven’t found anything remotely like the console table I’m looking for. If she’s true to form, Sunshine will start complaining around store number five. That’s where her antiquing patience tends to run out. Store number four is a high end one, two towns west of us, and I have to promise her ice cream after this one to get her to leave the truck."
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir, noon,73," Having traveled along Mars Highway 1 all day, I'm back at my campsite from yesterday. Tomorrow, I'll finally make real headway again. I was done driving and had the camp set up by noon. The efficiency loss here is 15.6%. Compared to the 17% loss at yesterday's camp, this means I can outrun the storm as long as I keep heading south. "
12:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo, noon,5,"At that point, I saw …” The soldier hesitated, and when he spoke again, his voice sounded less sure. “I don’t know exactly what I saw. A blaze of light. Bright as noon, brighter. Like staring into the sun”. The crowd erupted into murmurs. The survivors from the skiff were nodding, and I found myself nodding along with them."
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir, noon,73," As of noon yesterday, the northern-most logger showed 12.3% efficiency loss, the middle one was a 9.5% loss, and the rover recorded a 6.4% loss at its southernmost location. It paints a pretty clear picture: the storm front runs northwest to southeast. And I already worked out it's traveling west. "
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir, noon,73," Both loggers worked they way I'd hoped. I downloaded each of their video recordings to a laptop and advanced them to noon. Finally I had solar efficiency readings from three locations along an 80km line, all from the same time of day. "
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir, noon,70," The bedroom was inflated. Checking the timestamp on the image, it was from noon local time. She quickly found the status report; Watney always placed it close to the rover when rocks were in abundance, usually to the north. "
12:00:00,The Martian,Andy Weir, noon,18," I stood back and admired my work. Hey, I earned it. It wasn’t even noon and I was done. "
12:00:00,The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien, noon,17,"""Not so hasty""! said Bard. ""We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell""! With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Rac telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed."
12:00:00,The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien, noon,12,"Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside the tunnel by night. ""Now I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down this very noon-then if ever Smaug ought to be napping-and see what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience"". Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly."
12:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo, noon,31,"We walked in silence for a long time, moving up the mountain in slow switchbacks. In some spots, the trail was so narrow that I could do little more than cling to the mountainside, take tiny, shuffling steps, and hope the Saints were kind. Around noon, we descended the first slope and started up the second, which was, to my misery, even steeper and taller than the first. I stared at the trail in front of me, putting one foot in front of the other, trying to shake my sense of hopelessness. The more I thought about it, the more I worried that Mal might be right. I couldn’t lose the feeling that I’d doomed both of us."
12:00:00,Shadow and Bone,Leigh Bardugo, noon,39,"When they were almost upon us, the Darkling gripped my arm and simply said, “Now”. That invisible hand took hold of the power inside me, and I felt it stretch, reaching through the darkness of the Fold, seeking the light. It came to me with a speed and fury that nearly knocked me from my feet, breaking over me in a shower of brilliance and warmth. The Fold was alight, as bright as noon, as if its impenetrable darkness had never been. I saw a long reach of blanched sand, hulks of what looked like shipwrecks dotting the dead landscape, and above it all, a teeming flock of volcra. They screamed in terror, their writhing gray bodies gruesome in the bright sunlight. This is the truth of him, I thought as I squinted in the dazzling light."
12:00:00,The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien, noon,7,"But in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction."
12:00:00,Siege and Storm,Leigh Bardugo, noon,13,"Chapter 7 THE WINDS WARMED, and the waters turned from gray to blue as the Volkvolny carried us southeast to Ravka. Sturmhond’s crew was made up of sailors and rogue Grisha who worked together to keep the ship running smoothly. Despite the stories that had spread about the power of the second amplifier, they didn’t pay Mal or me much attention, though they occasionally came to watch me practice at the schooner’s stern. I was careful, never pushing too hard, always summoning at noon, when the sun was high in the sky and there was no chance of my efforts being spotted. Mal was still wary, but I’d spoken the truth: The sea whip’s power was a part of me now. It thrilled me. It buoyed me."
12:00:00,Siege and Storm,Leigh Bardugo, noon,15,"“Throw it wide! ” I didn’t stop to think. I cast the light out in a blazing wave. It showed the horror surrounding us in the harsh, unforgiving light of a noonday sun. There were volcra everywhere, suspended in the air around the ship, a mass of gray, winged, writhing bodies, milky, sightless eyes, and jaws crowded with teeth. Their resemblance to the nichevo’ya was unmistakable, and yet they were so much more grotesque, so much more clumsy. “Fire!"

12:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare, noon,22," “It’s almost noon,” he said. His voice sounded ordinary, but he still looked different to Emma, strangely different: the shape of his face, his shoulders under his T-shirt. “What did you want to talk to me about?”"
12:00:00,If I Stay,Gayle Forman, noon,17,"But I’m not ready. Not yet. I don’t know why, but I’m not. And I’m a little scared that if I accidentally think, I wouldn’t mind an endless nap, it will happen and be irreversible, like the way my grandparents used to warn me that if I made a funny face as the clock struck noon, it would remain like that forever. I wonder if every dying person gets to decide whether they stay or go. It seems unlikely. After all, this hospital is full of people having poisonous chemicals pumped into their veins or submitting to horrible operations all so they can stay, but some of them will die anyway."
12:00:00,Twilight,Stephenie Meyer, noon,30,"
It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since... well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest."
12:00:00,The Silver Chair,C. S. Lewis, noon,6,"""Oh, thank you, thank you ever so much,"" said Jill and Scrubb. ""But have a care,"" said the Lady. ""On whatever day you reach Harfang, that you come not to the door too late. For they shut their gates a few hours after noon, and it is the custom of the castle that they open to none when once they have drawn bolt, how hard so ever he knock"". The children thanked her again, with shining eyes, and the Lady waved to them. The Marsh-wiggle took off his steeple-hat and bowed very stiffly. Then the silent Knight and the Lady started walking their horses up the slope of the bridge with a great clatter of hoofs."
12:00:00,The Host,Stephenie Meyer, noon,38,"""You're exhausted, aren't you? Jared, could you get the door, please""? Wordlessly, Jared wrenched the red door back with a bit too much force and shoved it on top of the gray one. I now really saw Ian's room for the first time, with the noon sun filtering down through the narrow cracks in the ceiling. It wasn't as bright as Jamie and Jared's room, or as tall. It was smaller, more proportionate. Roundish-sort of like my hole, only ten times the size."

Judge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia. He opened it, read its contents and said, “Judge, I—this note is from my sister. She says my children are missing, haven’t turned up since noon . . . I . . . could you—”"
12:00:00,City of Lost Souls,Cassandra Clare, noon,38,"""Different spare rooms would be better,"" Alec muttered. Isabelle looked at Simon with questioning dark eyes, but he was already reaching into his pocket for his phone. ""Okay,"" he said. ""I'll be back by noon, but for now there's something important I have to do"". In the daylight Paris was a city of narrow, curving streets that opened out into wide avenues, mellow golden buildings with slate-colored roofs, and a glittering river that sliced across it like a dueling scar. Sebastian, despite his claim that he was going to prove to Clary that he had a plan, didn't say much as they made their way up a street lined with art galleries and stores selling dusty old books, to reach the Quai des Grands Augustins by the river's edge. There was a cool wind coming off the Seine, and she shivered."
12:00:00,City of Lost Souls,Cassandra Clare, noon,5,"""Yes"". She let out her held breath. ""Tomorrow. There's a local Conclave meeting at noon. Everyone'll be in it. I'm going in then"". ""I don't like it, Clary""."
12:00:00,The Horse and His Boy,C. S. Lewis, noon,2,CHAPTER TWO  A WAYSIDE ADVENTURE  IT was nearly noon on the following day when Shasta was wakened by something warm and soft moving over his face. He opened his eyes and found himself staring into the long face of a horse; its nose and lips were almost touching his. He remembered the exciting events of the previous night and sat up. But as he did so he groaned.
12:00:00,The Twilight Saga 2: New Moon,Stephenie Meyer, noon,17,"It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the horsepower and the color of the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring through the frame. I knew the rich smell of the leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint made noon look like dusk through those windows. It was Carlisle's car. ""Stop""! I cried again, louder this time, because Jacob was gunning the truck down the street."
12:00:00,City of Fallen Angels,Cassandra Clare, noon,10,"He perched himself on one of the slightly lopsided bar stools. Kyle pushed a chipped mug across the counter toward him. ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, bro. Even if it's already noon"". Simon put his hands around the mug, feeling the heat seep into his cold skin. He cast about for a topic of conversation-one that wasn't how little he ate. ""So, I never asked you yesterday-what do you do for a living""?"
12:00:00,Queen of Air and Darkness,Cassandra Clare, noon,8,"  The funeral was set for noon, but Emma had been tossing and turning since three or four in the morning. Her eyes felt dry and itchy and her hands shook as she brushed her hair and wound it carefully into a knot on the back of her head."
12:00:00,Lord of Shadows,Cassandra Clare, noon,106," It was nearly noon and the sun was high in the sky by the time they made it to Porthallow Church—apparently what was close for piskies wasn’t what humans would call nearby. Though Emma kept hearing the high voice of the piskie in her head. Killing close, it had said. Whatever that meant, she didn’t like the sound of it."
12:00:00,Lord of Shadows,Cassandra Clare, noon,91," Magnus sang. Cristina looked at him in surprise. He had a nice singing voice, though she didn’t know the melody. Sun, little sun, warm me a little, for the noon, for the dawning, for all the week long."
12:00:00,Lord of Shadows,Cassandra Clare, noon,25," The day stayed hot until the late afternoon, when a storm rolled in over the ocean. The Centurions had left before noon, and Emma couldn’t help but stare out the windows anxiously as the sun set behind a mass of black and gray clouds on the horizon, shot through with heat lightning."
12:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke, noon,38,"’  Mo was staring incredulously at the book in Capricorn’s hand as if he expected it to dissolve into thin air at any moment. ‘Have a rest, Silvertongue,’ said Capricorn. ‘Spare your precious voice. You’ll have plenty of time for that, because I have to go away, and I won’t be back till noon tomorrow. Take these three back to their quarters,’ he told his men. ‘Give them enough to eat, and some blankets for the night. Oh yes, and get Mortola to bring him tea."
12:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke, noon,39,"But now go hence quickly with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see. ’  Rudyard Kipling,  The Jungle Book  They did indeed get enough to eat. Around noon a woman brought them bread and olives, and towards evening there was pasta smelling of fresh rosemary. But the food couldn’t cut short the endless hours, any more than full stomachs dispelled their fear of what the next day might bring. Perhaps not even a book would have done it, but there was no point thinking of that, since they had no books, only the blank walls and the locked door. At least a new light bulb was hanging from the ceiling, so they didn’t have to sit in the dark the whole time."
12:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare, noon,53," Malcolm’s face had turned somber, despite the bright noon light reflecting off the ocean. “Don’t depend on me too much,” he said, so softly she wondered if he knew she would hear him."
12:00:00,Inkheart,Cornelia Funke, noon,103,"No, the story must have a happy ending. It wouldn’t be right otherwise! She had never liked sad stories. 56  The Shadow  My heavens are brass my earth is iron my moon a clod of clay  My sun a pestilence burning at noon & a vapour of death in the night. William Blake,  Enion’s Second Lament  In books hatred is often described as hot, but at Capricorn’s festivities Meggie discovered it was cold – an ice-cold hand that stops the heart and presses it like a clenched fist against the ribs. Hatred made her freeze, in spite of the mild air wafting around her telling her that the world was a good, safe place. She knew it was not – as the bloody cloth on which the smiling Capricorn had laid his ringed hand showed all too clearly."
12:00:00,Lady Midnight,Cassandra Clare, noon,24," “Come with me to breakfast,” Emma wheedled. “Or it might be brunch. It’s almost noon. But whatever—I want to introduce you to everyone. I want you to meet Julian—”"
12:00:00,City of Glass,Cassandra Clare, noon,31,"“‘If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help—’” Simon knew he couldn’t pray. He’d tried it before, and the name of God burned his mouth and choked his throat. He wondered why he could think the words but not say them. And why he could stand in the noonday sun and not die but he couldn’t say his last prayers. Smoke had begun to drift down the corridor like a purposeful ghost. He could smell burning and hear the crackle of fire spreading out of control, but he felt oddly detached, far from everything. It was strange to become a vampire, to be presented with what could only be described as an eternal life, and then to die anyway when you were sixteen."
12:00:00,The Last Olympian,Rick Riordan, noon,4,"He'd sacrificed himself to take out the Princess Andromeda, and I had abandoned him. I thought about my dream: the Titans discussing the explosion as if it didn't matter, Nico di Angelo warning me that I would never beat Kronos without following his plan—a dangerous idea I'd been avoiding for more than a year. A distant blast shook the room. Green light blazed outside, turning the whole sea as bright as noon. ""What was that""? I asked. Tyson looked worried."
12:00:00,The Battle of the Labyrinth,Rick Riordan, noon,43,"He lit the funeral pyre in the middle of the amphitheater, and within seconds the row of shrouds was engulfed in fire, sending smoke and sparks up to the stars. We spent the next day treating the wounded, which was almost everybody. The satyrs and dryads worked to repair the damage to the woods. At noon, the Council of Cloven Elders held an emergency meeting in their sacred grove. The three senior satyrs were there, along with Chiron, who was in wheelchair form. His broken horse leg was still mending, so he would be confined to the chair for a few months, until the leg was strong enough to take his weight. The grove was filled with satyrs and dryads and naiads up from the water—hundreds of them, anxious to hear what would happen."
12:00:00,Throne of Glass,Sarah J. Maas, Noon,8,“The queen’s court”. He grabbed her arm and pulled her down the hall. “Queen Georgina?
12:00:00,The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins, noon,5,"Pulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch."
12:00:00,Insurgent,Veronica Roth, noon,17,"I find out that the Candor boy Eric shot in the head was named Bobby, and that Eric is in stable condition, and that of the hundreds of people in the Merciless Mart, only eighty don’t have needles buried in their flesh, seventy of whom are Dauntless, one of whom is Christina. All night I puzzle over needles and serums and simulations, trying to inhabit the minds of my enemies. In the morning, I run out of needles to remove and go to the cafeteria, rubbing my eyes. Jack Kang announced that we would have a meeting at noon, so maybe I can fit in a long nap after I eat. When I walk into the cafeteria, though, I see Caleb. Caleb runs up to me and folds me carefully into his arms. I breathe a sigh of relief."
12:00:00,Insurgent,Veronica Roth, noon,11,"So I shake my head. “All right, then”. He checks his watch. “It is now noon. The interrogation will be at seven. Don’t bother preparing for it. You can’t withhold information while under the influence of truth serum”."
12:00:00,Divergent,Veronica Roth, noon,32,"Then they all share a meal, each person serving food to the person on his left. The Dauntless don’t do that. Initiation day plunges the Dauntless compound into insanity and chaos. There are people everywhere, and most of them are inebriated by noon. I fight my way through them to get a plate of food at lunch and carry it back to the dormitory with me. On the way I see someone fall off the path on the Pit wall and, judging by his screams and the way he grabs at his leg, he broke something. The dormitory, at least, is quiet."
12:00:00,Crown of Midnight,Sarah J. Maas, noon,26,"If he wound up on the executioner’s block because of it, he’d surely kick himself for being so brash, but he had exhausted every other way of finding out why he was plagued by magic. This was his only option. He found Baba Yellowlegs sitting on the back steps of her giant wagon, a chipped plate heaped with roast chicken parts resting on her knees, a pile of clean-licked bones littering the ground below. She lifted her yellowed eyes to him, iron teeth glinting in the noontime sun as she bit into a chicken leg. “Carnival’s closed for lunch”. He swallowed his irritation. Getting answers relied on two things: being on her good side, and her not knowing who he was."
12:00:00,The Lost World,Michael Crichton, noon,3,"The Lost World Hypothesis  The lecture ended, Malcolm hobbled across the open courtyard of the Institute, shortly after noon. Walking beside him was Sarah Harding, a young field biologist visiting from Africa. Malcolm had known her for several years, since he had been asked to serve as an Outside reader for her doctoral thesis at Berkeley. Crossing the courtyard in the hot summer sun, they made an unlikely pair: Malcolm dressed in black, stooped and ascetic, leaning on his cane; Harding compact and muscular, looking young and energetic in shorts and a tee shirt, her short black hair pushed up on her forehead with sunglasses."
12:00:00,Heir of Fire,Sarah J. Maas, noon,6,"The cold fury of his magic clawed its way up his spine. “With all due respect, Father, I have two meetings to prepare for, and—”  “It’s not open for debate”. His father kept eating. “General Ashryver has been notified, and you will meet him outside your chambers at noon”. Dorian knew he should keep quiet, but he found himself asking, “Why do you tolerate Aedion? Why keep him alive—­why make him a general? ” He’d been unable to stop wondering about it since the man’s arrival."
12:00:00,A Court of Thorns and Roses,Sarah J. Maas, noon,41," The next day, the blood of the faerie had been cleaned up by the time I ate, washed, and dressed. I’d taken my time in the morning, and it was nearly noon as I stood atop the staircase, peering down at the entry hall below. Just to make sure it was gone. "
12:00:00,The 5th Wave,Rick Yancey, Noon,29,"Communications. My favorite is survival training. That memorable session where we had to drink our own urine. 12:00 P.M.: Noon chow. Some mystery meat between hard crusts of bread. Dumbo, whose jokes are as tasteless as his ears are big, cracks that we’re not incinerating the infested bodies but grinding them up to feed the troops. I have to pull Teacup off him before she smacks his head with a tray."
12:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green, noon,26,"“Seriously, we better be stopping at the Gap,” Ben adds. Radar’s job, which he begins with the calculator on his handheld, is Research and Calculations. He’s alone in the row of seats behind me, with the directions and the minivan’s owner’s manual spread out next to him. He’s figuring out how fast we need to travel in order to make it by noon tomorrow, how many times we’ll need to stop in order to keep the car from running out of gas, the locations of BP stations on our route and how long each stop will be, and how much time we’ll lose in the process of slowing down to exit. “We gotta stop four times for gas. The stops will have to be very very short. Six minutes at the most off-highway."
12:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green, Noon,25,"Esso suspected copyright infringement and prepared several lawsuits, but in fact, an unknown resident had built “The Agloe General Store” at the intersection that appeared on the Esso map. The building, which still stands [needs citation], is the only structure in Agloe, which continues to appear on many maps and is traditionally recorded as having a population of zero. Every Omnictionary entry contains subpages where you can view all the edits ever made to the page and any discussion by Omnictionary members about it. The Agloe page hadn’t been edited by anyone in almost a year, but there was one recent comment on the talk page by an anonymous user: fyi, whoever Edits this—the Population of agloe Will actually be One until may 29th at Noon. I recognized the capitalization immediately. The rules of capitalization are so unfair to words in the middle of a sentence. My throat tightened, but I forced myself to calm down."
12:00:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green, noon,25,"“Gives you an idea how I feel about you,” he said. My old man. He always knew just what to say. CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE A couple days later, I got up around noon and drove over to Isaac’s house. He answered the door himself. “My mom took Graham to a movie,” he said. “We should go do something,” I said."
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, noon,30, Screaming halted the music. Aelin was already moving for the nearby stage as the clock tower—that clock tower that would save or damn them all—struck noon.
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, noon,31," The smoke billowed out ahead, leading the way into the garden. Aelin pushed Aedion’s head down as she shoved him into the mass of fleeing courtiers and servants. Thrashing, squeezing, shouting, ripping at her clothes, until—until the noontime sun blinded her."
12:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins, noon,4,"Not one of the boys grew a beard, and many were old enough to. I wonder what they did to them. If I feel ragged, my prep team seems in worse condition, knocking back coffee and sharing brightly colored little pills. As far as I can tell, they never get up before noon unless there's some sort of national emergency, like my leg hair. I was so happy when it grew back in, too. As if it were a sign that things might be returning to normal. I run my fingers along the soft, curly down on my legs and give myself over to the team."
12:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins, noon,7,"I think of how hard Hazelle has worked to keep that family alive. Surely she'll be on my side in this matter. Or won't she? It must be getting on toward noon now and the days are so short. No point in being in the woods after dark if you don't have to. I stamp out the remains of my little fire, clear up the scraps of food, and tuck Cinna's gloves in my belt. I guess I'll hang on to them for a while."
12:00:00,A Court of Thorns and Roses,Sarah J. Maas, noon,41," We sat atop a grassy knoll, overlooking a glade of oaks so wide and high they could have been the pillars and spires of an ancient castle. Shimmering tufts of dandelion fluff drifted by, and the floor of the clearing was carpeted with swaying crocuses and snowdrops and bluebells. It was an hour or two past noon by the time we arrived, but the light was thick and golden. "
12:00:00,A ​Court of Silver Flames,Sarah J. Maas, noon,64," Nesta drifted to the front of the shop, but then said, at last voicing her reason for visiting, “The training I’m doing with Cassian in the House of Wind is open to anyone—any female, I mean. Females who have experienced … hardship.” Emerie’s wings, her horrible family, were not the same as what Gwyn had endured, but everyone’s traumas wore different masks. “We train each morning, from nine to eleven, though we sometimes run until noon. You’re welcome to come.”"
12:00:00,A Court of Mist and Fury,Sarah J. Maas, noon,20," But when I emerged at noon, he was waiting upstairs, that faint, amused smile on his face. He nudged me toward the table he’d arranged with books and paper and ink. "
12:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,twelve o'clock,25,"Beetee smiles at us as if we've exceeded his expectations. ""Yes, good. You do see. Now here's what I propose: a twelve o'clock strike. What happens exactly at noon and at midnight""? ""The lightning bolt hits the tree,"" I say. ""Yes."
12:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins,Twelve o'clock,23,"We decide to head to the beach at twelve o'clock. That should provide hours of calm and keep us clear of any poisonous residue. And then Peeta, Johanna, and Finnick head off in three different directions. ""Twelve o'clock, right""? says Peeta. ""The tail points at twelve"". ""Before they spun us,"" says Finnick."
12:00:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green, noon,23,"Or did an omnipotent God create the basketballs out of the vacuum of space? Is this heaven in some kind of unobservable universe where the laws of physics don’t apply, and if so, why in the hell would I be playing basketball when I could be flying or reading or looking at beautiful people or something else I actually enjoy? It’s almost as if the way you imagine my dead self says more about you than it says about either the person I was or the whatever I am now. His parents called around noon to say the funeral would be in five days, on Saturday. I pictured a church packed with people who thought he liked basketball, and I wanted to puke, but I knew I had to go, since I was speaking and everything. When I hung up, I went back to reading his wall: Just heard that Gus Waters died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Rest in peace, buddy."
12:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas, noon,2," I braced myself, schooling my face into bland curiosity, as he declared, “The first delegation from Hybern arrives tomorrow.” Lucien’s golden skin paled. Tamlin added, “Jurian will be here by noon.” "
12:00:00,A Court of Wings and Ruin,Sarah J. Maas, noon,14," Winnowing felt like wading through mud. In fact, my powers had become more of a burden than a help. I had a throbbing headache by noon, and spent the last leg of the journey dizzy and disoriented as we winnowed again and again. "
12:00:00,Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins, noon,12,"People screaming and cheering for their favorites, booing the ones they don't like. Having voted, and probably bet on the winner, people are very invested in my wedding gown. It's bizarre to watch when I think how I never even bothered to try one on before the cameras arrived. Caesar announces that interested parties must cast their final vote by noon on the following day. ""Let's get Katniss Everdeen to her wedding in style""! he hollers to the crowd. I'm about to shut off the television, but then Caesar is telling us to stay tuned for the other big event of the evening."

""Stay with me"". As the tendrils of sleep syrup pull me down, I hear him whisper a word back, but I don't quite catch it. My mother lets me sleep until noon, then rouses me to examine my heel. I'm ordered to a week of bed rest and I don't object because I feel so lousy. Not just my heel and my tailbone. My whole body aches with exhaustion."
12:00:00,Kingdom of Ash,Sarah J. Maas, noon,5,"“How many can your wyvern form carry? ”  CHAPTER 2   Elide Lochan had once hoped to travel far and wide, to a place where no one had ever heard of Adarlan or Terrasen, so distant that Vernon didn’t stand a chance of finding her. She hadn’t anticipated that it might actually happen. Standing in the dusty, ancient alley of an equally dusty, ancient city in a kingdom south of Doranelle, Elide marveled at the noontime bells ringing across the clear sky, the sun baking the pale stones of the buildings, the dry wind sweeping through the narrow streets between them. She’d learned the name of this city thrice now, and still couldn’t pronounce it. She supposed it didn’t matter. They wouldn’t be here long."

12:00:00,Kingdom of Ash,Sarah J. Maas, noon,199," Distantly, far away, Yrene knew she was incandescent with light, brighter than a noontime sun. Knew that the dark king beneath her was nothing more than a writhing pit of snakes, biting at her, trying to poison her light."
12:00:00,A Thousand Splendid Suns,Khaled Hosseini, noon,38,"Aziza's greeting to Rasheed was rigid but not hostile. Rasheed said they should hurry, he had only two hours before he had to report back to work. This was his first week as a doorman for the Intercontinental. From noon to eight, six days a week, Rasheed opened car doors, carried luggage, mopped up the occasional spill. Sometimes, at day's end, the cook at the buffet-style restaurant let Rasheed bring home a few leftovers - as long as he was discreet about it - cold meatballs sloshing in oil; fried chicken wings, the crust gone hard and dry; stuffed pasta shells turned chewy; stiff, gravelly rice. Rasheed had promised Laila that once he had some money saved up, Aziza could move back home. Rasheed was wearing his uniform, a burgundy red polyester suit, white shirt, clip-on tie, visor cap pressing down on his white hair."
12:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green, noon,10,"There were only two weeks of classes before exams—the coming one and the one after Thanksgiving—and so far, the best personal answer I had to “What happens to people after they die? ” was “Well, something. Maybe”. The Colonel came in at noon, his thick übermath book cradled in his arms. “I just saw Sara,” he said. “How’d that work out for ya? ” “Bad."
12:00:00,The Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan, noon,10,"The letters looked Greek to me. I mean, literally Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns, like those in an architecture book. ""Annabeth,"" Chiron said, ""I have masters' archery class at noon.

I turned, and there he was in the night sky, flying in from twelve o'clock with his winged  shoes fluttering, Grover, holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat. His eyes were shut tight, his head twitched from side to side. He was navigating by ears and nose alone. ""Duck""!"
12:00:00,The Lightning Thief,Rick Riordan, noon,43,"I'd finally found a family, people who cared about me and thought I'd done something right.

Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barber’s front steps, but all they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door.

We arrived at my mom’s apartment around noon. When she answered the door, she gave me a hug only a little less overwhelming than having a hellhound jump on you. “I told them you were all right,” my mom said, but she sounded like the weight of the sky had just been lifted off her shoulders—and believe me, I know firsthand how that feels. She sat us down at the kitchen table and insisted on feeding us her special blue chocolate-chip cookies while we caught her up on the quest."

Finally, the last day of camp arrived. The standard form letter appeared on my bed after breakfast, warning me that the cleaning harpies would devour me if I stayed past noon. At ten o’clock I stood on the top of Half-Blood Hill, waiting for the camp van that would take me into the city. I’d made arrangements to leave Mrs. O’Leary at camp, where Chiron promised she’d be looked after. Tyson and I would take turns visiting her during the year."
12:00:00,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, noon,18,"Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information. It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness."
12:00:00,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen, noon,31,"They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply. Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon. Chapter 45 Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed. On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn."
12:00:00,The Fault in Our Stars,John Green, noon,12,"Mom countered that since she was twice as large as me and therefore required more physical fabric to preserve her modesty, she deserved at least two-thirds of the suitcase. In the end, we both lost. So it goes. Our flight didn’t leave until noon, but Mom woke me up at five thirty, turning on the light and shouting, “AMSTERDAM! ” She ran around all morning making sure we had international plug adapters and quadruple-checking that we had the right number of oxygen tanks to get there and that they were all full, etc. , while I just rolled out of bed, put on my Travel to Amsterdam Outfit (jeans, a pink tank top, and a black cardigan in case the plane was cold). The car was packed by six fifteen, whereupon Mom insisted that we eat breakfast with Dad, although I had a moral opposition to eating before dawn on the grounds that I was not a nineteenth-century Russian peasant fortifying myself for a day in the fields."

12:00:00,Persuasion,Jane Austen, noon,12,"Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go-Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth. The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning. They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner. This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone. After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea. They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer. The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better."
12:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green, noon,23,"He called at ten. I picked him up in the minivan and then we drove to Ben’s house, figuring that a surprise attack would be the only way to wake him up. But even singing “You Are My Sunshine” outside his window only resulted in him opening the window and spitting at us. “I’m not doing anything until noon,” he said authoritatively. So it was just Radar and me on the drive out. He talked a little about Angela and how much he liked her and how weird it was to fall in love just a few months before they would leave for different colleges, but I found it hard to listen very well. I wanted that map."
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, noon,104,"Considering the fact that they were using hellfire, things could go very, very wrong. Chaol hadn’t been able to meet with Ress or Brullo yet, but tried every day to get messages to them. The real difficulty, it seemed, was that over half the rebels had fled as more Valg soldiers poured in. Three executions a day was the new rule: sunrise, noon, and sunset. Former magic-wielders, rebels, suspected rebel sympathizers—Chaol and Nesryn managed to save some, but not all. The cawing of crows could now be heard on every street."
12:00:00,Paper Towns,John Green, noon,20,"The beer waved back. 23. I slept for a few hours and then spent the morning poring over the travel guides I’d discovered the day before. I waited until noon to call Ben and Radar. I called Ben first. “Good morning, Sunshine,” I said. “Oh, God,” Ben said, his voice dripping abject misery."
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, noon,111, The noontime bells were ringing.
12:00:00,Looking for Alaska,John Green, noon,26,"And your mother—so beautiful”. I rolled my eyes, a bit disgusted. Still, I liked this stripper fellow. The Eagle came in at noon on the nose, greeted the senior-class speaker—a former Alabama state attorney general—and then came over to Dr. Morse, who stood with great aplomb and half bowed as he shook the Eagle’s hand—maybe too formal—and the Eagle said, “We’re certainly very glad to have you here,” and Maxx replied, “Thank you. I hope I don’t disappoint”. I wasn’t worried about getting expelled. I wasn’t even worried about getting the Colonel expelled, although maybe I should have been."
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, Noon,111, The clock tower. Noon.
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, Noon,111, Noon had come and gone.
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, noon,111," Around and around, up and up she flew. It was past noon. If something had gone wrong with Rowan and Aedion …"
12:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas, noon,19," By noon on the third day, she was close to weeping. From exhaustion, from rage, from bone-deep fear. Whatever took its time hunting her would surely take its time killing her."
12:00:00,Empire of Storms,Sarah J. Maas, noon,62," Rowan palmed his hunting knife, the steel bright in the blazing sun. High noon."
12:00:00,Forrest Gump,Winston Groom, noon,12,"All along, the spaceship be boilin an hissin an growlin an steamin. Somebody say a hundrit million people out there watchin us on television. I reckon they be waitin too. Anyhow, bout noon, somebody come up an knock on the spaceship door an say, we is temporarily cancelin this mission till they get the spaceship fixed. So we all get to go back down in the elevator again, me, Sue, an Major Fritch. She be the only one moanin an bitchin, cause Sue an me is very relieved. Our relief was not to last long, however."
12:00:00,Sense and Sensibility,Jane Austen,twelve o'clock,37,"HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought."
12:00:00,Tower of Dawn,Sarah J. Maas, noon,29," His arms were trembling by the time the clock on the sideboard chimed noon, little silver bells atop the carved wood piece filling the space with clear, bright ringing. Sweat slid down his chest, his spine, his face as he managed to haul himself into his chair, arms trembling with the effort. He was about to call for Kadja to bring him a jug of water and a cool cloth when Yrene appeared."
12:00:00,Queen of Shadows,Sarah J. Maas, Noon,111," Noon, he had promised Aelin. As the sun began to reach its apex on the solstice, they’d bring the tower crashing down."
12:00:00,A Thousand Splendid Suns,Khaled Hosseini, noon,22,"* * *  ON THE THIRD MORNING, Laila began moving the piles of things to the yard and depositing them by the front door. They would fetch a taxi then and take it all to a pawnshop. Laila kept shuffling between the house and the yard, back and forth, carrying stacks of clothes and dishes and box after box of Babi's books. She should have been exhausted by noon, when the mound of belongings by the front door had grown waist high. But, with each trip, she knew that she was that much closer to seeing Tariq again, and, with each trip, her legs became more sprightly, her arms more tireless. ""We're going to need a big taxi"". Laila looked up."
,To All the Boys I've Loved Before,Jenny Han,five minutes past eight,27,"The clock reads five minutes past eight. The bell’s going to ring soon. “We should get going,” I say, and when I stand up, my knees feel shaky. “Ready?”"
,Allegiant,Veronica Roth,five minutes to midnight,5,"“I bet Evelyn’s monitoring all the electricity usage—it’s the best way to figure out if people are meeting in secret”. I sigh. I may like to run, but I hate climbing stairs. When we finally reach the top of the stairs, our chests heaving, it is five minutes to midnight. The others go ahead while I catch my breath near the elevator bank. Uriah was right—there isn’t a single light on that I can see, apart from the exit signs. It is in their blue glow that I see Tobias emerge from the interrogation room up ahead."
,Allegiant,Veronica Roth,two minutes to midnight,5,"It is in their blue glow that I see Tobias emerge from the interrogation room up ahead. Since our date I have spoken to him only in covert messages. I have to resist the urge to throw myself at him and brush my fingers over the curl of his lip and the crease in his cheek when he smiles and the hard line of his eyebrow and jaw. But it’s two minutes to midnight. We don’t have any time. He wraps his arms around me and holds me tight for a few seconds. His breaths tickle my ear, and I close my eyes, letting myself finally relax."
